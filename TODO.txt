Online version:


php:
	In Variable, make sure process name is being passed correctly in the PHP
	Fix list binding in SQL statements

python script:
	Why is it not iterating over all files?
		Maybe related to two pull requests?

Deploy:


Explore:
	TODO: go through each row and check that the pk isn't already included in the table
	When nodes are added, it's supplying the id as the name, not the pk.	
		(changed in vis_network_utils)
	Remove nodes
	Allow changing of network layout
	Colour edges by: type, Cor, Stage
	When node or edge is highlighted, filter datatable



Variable:
	

Finish addData.js
	
	Add date added? (so we can do recently added)
		Add to contributor line in addData.js
	Network:
		Add button: warn if variable not in database?

	LOW Add button to remove variable from network (see commented button delNetworkElement).
		Should prob iterate through *grid*, then update network from grid.
		Not necessary right now


Help:
	Offer template csv in help section.

Cookies:
	TEST Store temporary variable names in cookie
	TEST Store version number


Documents: 


Document:
	LOW If bibtex has an abstract field, display it.
	Display causal links graph vis.js (use general function)
	Links table:
		Add button to make change request via github
	Add link to download raw data from github repository

causal_links:


Database:
	"immitation" -> imitation
	Include new table linking nodes to a date in time.
	e.g. Control of fire: 1 million ya

Link: 
	(Maybe not: just use Explore) Create page for link, add documents that relate to it


Graphical display:
	Add node
	Expland node
		updateGrid: Check we haven't already added the data.
	Colour edges by:
		Evidence type, correltion direction
		Number of edges
	Find shortest/ all paths between two links?
		This requires full SQL: http://aprogrammerwrites.eu/?p=1391#.WlUQPUu3yRs
		So maybe output the database in a compact graph format, load with python and implement Dijkstra's algorithm for listing all paths?
	General function to display causal links given a list of links
		Plus option to focus/emphasise a particular variable
	Find brokers
	Find bridging theories (References that nodes in two other references)
