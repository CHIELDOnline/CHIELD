From Research IT:


PHP
	PHP: avoid using shell_exec, use just exec
	Escape anything sent to sendToRepo.py by the php file
		This is hard: we don't want to escape the ">" relation.
		Possible solution: escape < and > to &gt;
		In the R script, convert Relation field back to > and <, and check that it's one of the approved types.

Escape table input in javascript.


R script: Regexp - take out control characters hex 0-31


Configuration:
	Create "configuration" folder for custom stuff

Documentation:
	Create diagram of how data flows
	General thinking
	Reservations

Help

	Add tips for coding causal links
		Try to re-use variable names
			Measurable things
		Break hypothesis down
		Try to use direct quotes

Topics:
	Make topics page

php:
	

python script:

	When editing, we can download the contents of the current contributor file, and automatically add the new line (instead of overwriting it).

Deploy:
	Don't write zip file to local app folder, but directly to server folder
		(so we don't end up always updating it in git)
	

Explore:
		
	Colour edges by: Publication

	Add button to find all direct links between two nodes

	Somehow link edges to data

	Add edges by document

	Tidy up "existing variables" code: should move to db,
	 but addData has custom parts in overloaded method `recieveVariablesFromServer`

	Find brokers
	Find bridging theories (References that nodes in two other references)



Variable:
	Summarise number of links where variable appears
	

addData:
	TEST: does adding new data still work?

	Bib source: at the moment we write some extra data in the first two lines
		We could just pass the bibtex record, and get the python file to decode it and find the year and bibref?

	LOW Add button to remove variable from network (see commented button delNetworkElement).
		Should prob iterate through *grid*, then update network from grid.
		Not necessary right now

Documents: 

Document:
	Add "Explore" button: Send URL parameter for list of variables

	LOW If bibtex has an abstract field, display it.
	Freeze first three columns
		Doesn't seem to work.
	

causal_links:


Database:
	Add important people: Kirby, Hurford etc.
	Check Wheeler, P. E. (1985). The loss of functional body hair in man.  
		Causal links don't mention hair (and paper doesn't mention encephalisation?)

Future:
	List of academics, do academic network discovery

	Include new table linking nodes to a date in time.
		e.g. Control of fire: 1 million ya
		Could add as a timeline: http://visjs.org/timeline_examples.html
	Include "Theory" table:
		A collection of causal link ids with a name
		Is this just the "Process" field?

	Pagiation (Next/Previous): fix to bottom of window?
