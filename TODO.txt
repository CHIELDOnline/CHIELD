	How to colour "~" node? (dashed?)
		
	Colour edges by: Publication

	Add button to find all direct links between two nodes

	Somehow link edges to data

	Add edges by document


	Tidy up "existing variables" code: should move to db,
	 but addData has custom parts in overloaded method `recieveVariablesFromServer`

	Find brokers
	Find bridging theories (References that nodes in two other references)



Variable:
	

addData:
	TEST: does adding new data still work?

	When editing, formatted bib reference does not update.

	What if user loads saved data from cookie, but this is editing? 
	LOW Add button to remove variable from network (see commented button delNetworkElement).
		Should prob iterate through *grid*, then update network from grid.
		Not necessary right now



Documents: 


Document:
	LOW If bibtex has an abstract field, display it.
	Freeze first three columns
		Doesn't seem to work.
	

causal_links:


Database:

	Fix Hunley, Cabana, Merriwether & Long (2007)
	Fix Dall'Asta, Baronchelli, Barrat & Loreto (2006)

	Add important people: Kirby, Hurford etc.
	Fix measured by: decide on ~= or =~ 

	"Type" for evolang11_26 is "stone tool knapping"

Future:
	List of academics, do academic network discovery

	Include new table linking nodes to a date in time.
		e.g. Control of fire: 1 million ya
		Could add as a timeline: http://visjs.org/timeline_examples.html
	Include "Theory" table:
		A collection of causal link ids with a name
		Is this just the "Process" field?

Cosmetic 
	Pagiation (Next/Previous): fix to bottom of window?
		#documents_table_paginate{
			position: fixed;
			bottom: 10px;
