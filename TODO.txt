FIX: Explore: Cluster groups all "X:Y" into "X", but does not add just "X".

AddData: Validate: don't allow to submit with blank variable names

From Research IT:


PHP
	PHP: avoid using shell_exec, use just exec
	Escape anything sent to sendToRepo.py by the php file
		This is hard: we don't want to escape the ">" relation.
		Possible solution: escape < and > to &gt;
		In the R script, convert Relation field back to > and <, and check that it's one of the approved types.

Escape table input in javascript.

R script: Regexp - take out control characters hex 0-31

Configuration:
	Create "configuration" folder for custom stuff

Documentation:
	Create diagram of how data flows
	General thinking
	Reservations



Output to an igraph-compatible format, e.g. graphml
Output to DOT

	FIX: When removing node, the datatable needs to be updated (remove rows)

	FIX: When search inputs blur, hide them.

	From Peter:
		TEST Variables appear far away from each other

	Colour edges by: Publication
	Add button to find all direct links between two nodes?

	Disable buttons until they can be used
	
	Tidy up "existing variables" code: should move to db,
	 but addData has custom parts in overloaded method `recieveVariablesFromServer`

	Somehow link edges to data?
	Find brokers
	Find bridging theories (References that nodes in two other references)



Variable:
	Summarise number of links where variable appears
	Link to Explore 
	

addData:

	Submit tab: Can add commit message explaining the change?
		
	In GUI_for_addData.js, redrawGUIfromGrid(): Currently, when new data is added, we call `initialiseNetwork()`, which is a bit of a waste, and maybe causes the weird physics problems?


	Bib source: at the moment we write some extra data in the first two lines
		We could just pass the bibtex record, and get the python file to decode it and find the year and bibref?

	LOW Add button to remove variable from network (see commented button delNetworkElement).
		Should prob iterate through *grid*, then update network from grid.
		Not necessary right now

	Check Wheeler, P. E. (1985). The loss of functional body hair in man.  
		Causal links don't mention hair (and paper doesn't mention encephalisation?)

Future:
	List of academics, do academic network discovery

	Include new table linking nodes to a date in time.
		e.g. Control of fire: 1 million ya
		Could add as a timeline: http://visjs.org/timeline_examples.html
	Include "Theory" table:
		A collection of causal link ids with a name
		Is this just the "Process" field?
