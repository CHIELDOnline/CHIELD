FIX: Explore: on mobile, can select multiple nodes, but "find path" hangs



Online version:


From Research IT:


PHP
	PHP: avoid using shell_exec, use just exec


Configuration:
	Create "configuration" folder for custom stuff

Documentation:
	Reservations



Help:
	Add tips for coding causal links
		Try to re-use variable names
			Measurable things
		Break hypothesis down
		Try to use direct quotes

Topics:
	Make topics page

php:

Home page:
	
	

python script:
	Add commit message from web form

Deploy:
	
	

Explore:

	Add "Bulk out" button: find links that match current links.
	
	FIX: When removing node, the datatable needs to be updated (remove rows)
		We should re-do everything so that there's only one canonical source
		Or at least only pushing data one way.  We can probably remove database_records? Or at least just update the datatable data.

	From Peter:
		TEST Variables appear far away from each other

	FIX: When adding document, need to re-cluster?
		Or just remove clusters

	Add button to remove edges (not nodes);

	Add by document: Show loader before request

	Disable buttons until they can be used
	
	Tidy up "existing variables" code: should move to db,
	 but addData has custom parts in overloaded method `recieveVariablesFromServer`

	Somehow link edges to data?
	Find brokers
	Find bridging theories (References that nodes in two other references)

	Highlight overlap: Allow highlighting of nodes that appear in all documents

	Hide Doc when click away.

	Set edge colour by document isn't working for large networks?
	Edge colour by stage/evidence: remove "none"?

Meta:
	Build webpage, js

Variable:
	Summarise number of links where variable appears
	Link to Explore 
	

addData:

	Nodes don't jump around:
		network_options.physics.stabilization.enabled = false
		network.setOptions({physics:{enabled:false}})
	
	Allow editing of Notes in seperate window/popup.

	Submit tab: Can add commit message explaining the change?
		
	In GUI_for_addData.js, redrawGUIfromGrid(): Currently, when new data is added, we call `initialiseNetwork()`, which is a bit of a waste, and maybe causes the weird physics problems?


	Bib source: at the moment we write some extra data in the first two lines
		We could just pass the bibtex record, and get the python file to decode it and find the year and bibref?

	LOW Add button to remove variable from network (see commented button delNetworkElement).
		Should prob iterate through *grid*, then update network from grid.
		Not necessary right now

	in dataHeaders: " { type: "control" }" : is this necessary?

Documents: 
	Add stage?

Document:

	php file getConnectionsToDoc.php seems to have dead first sql code?

	Show quote when click on edge.
	LOW If bibtex has an abstract field, display it.
	Freeze first three columns
		Doesn't seem to work.
	

causal_links:
	Add stage


Database:
	Add important people: Kirby, Hurford etc.

About:
	

Downloads:
	

Search by evolution stage


Future:
	List of academics, do academic network discovery

	Include new table linking nodes to a date in time.
		e.g. Control of fire: 1 million ya
		Could add as a timeline: http://visjs.org/timeline_examples.html
	Include "Theory" table:
		A collection of causal link ids with a name
		Is this just the "Process" field?
