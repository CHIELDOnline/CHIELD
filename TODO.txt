		Try to re-use variable names
			Measurable things
		Break hypothesis down
		Try to use direct quotes

	Colour edges by: Publication

	Add button to find all direct links between two nodes

	Somehow link edges to data

	Add edges by document

	Tidy up "existing variables" code: should move to db,
	 but addData has custom parts in overloaded method `recieveVariablesFromServer`

	Find brokers
	Find bridging theories (References that nodes in two other references)



Variable:
	

addData:
	TEST: does adding new data still work?

	LOW Add button to remove variable from network (see commented button delNetworkElement).
		Should prob iterate through *grid*, then update network from grid.
		Not necessary right now

Documents: 


Document:
	LOW If bibtex has an abstract field, display it.
	Freeze first three columns
		Doesn't seem to work.

	Fix Dall'Asta, Baronchelli, Barrat & Loreto (2006)

	Add important people: Kirby, Hurford etc.
	Fix measured by: decide on ~= or =~ 

	"Type" for evolang11_26 is "stone tool knapping"

Future:
	List of academics, do academic network discovery

	Include new table linking nodes to a date in time.
		e.g. Control of fire: 1 million ya
		Could add as a timeline: http://visjs.org/timeline_examples.html
	Include "Theory" table:
		A collection of causal link ids with a name
		Is this just the "Process" field?

Cosmetic 
	Pagiation (Next/Previous): fix to bottom of window?
		#documents_table_paginate{
			position: fixed;
			bottom: 10px;
