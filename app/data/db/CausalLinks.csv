Adults learning a foreign language often lack the breadth of exposure to the target language that a native speaker would have. Thus, they only partially learn the range of inflectional variants of a word, and omit morphological markers in their language production (Papadopoulou et al., 2011; Haznedar, 2006; Gurel, 2000). If non-native speakers represent a considerable part of the overall speaker population, they might drive the language towards morphological simplification."
