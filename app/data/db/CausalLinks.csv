(2) Seven of the nine children show a verb spurt at around 1;7; for six of these children the verb spurt occurs before the noun spurt. No such early verb spurt is found in the English data. Unlike in English, both verbs and nouns in Korean are dominant categories from the single-word stage. (3) Korean children express language-specific distinctions of locative actions with verbs. Study 2, a crosslinguistic study of caregivers' input in English and Korean, shows that Korean mothers provide more action verbs but fewer object nouns than American mothers. Also, Korean mothers engage in activity-oriented discourse significantly more than American mothers. Our study suggests that verbs are accessible to children from the beginning, and that they may be acquired early in children who are encouraged to do so by their language-specific grammar and input."

Two experiments showed reliable effects of frequency (though in the opposite direction to that reported by Klein) but no effects of AoA. Experiment 1 produced a dissociation between frequency and AoA when manipulated orthogonally. Experiment 2 produced the same dissociation using different stimuli. In contrast, both variables reliably influenced word naming. These findings are inconsistent with the view that frequency and AoA are 2 aspects of a single underlying mechanism."

However, zero-order correlations between our individual sonority classes and all these variables indicate little beyond chance outcomes, with only 11% of all runs being significant, and no single class being significantly related to the above variables more than twice. The inference seems clear that the embers� results apply not to the constituent classes of sound but to overall sonority scores, which are nevertheless still related to climatic zones."

Third, interactants in large groups must be able to identify and store data pertaining to each exchange, each of which requires the computation of many distinct cost/benefit ratios and complex forms of reciprocity (Boyd and Richerson, 2006). These cost/benefit ratios must be constantly adjusted over time to reflect the increased cost of performing a costly act without receiving a benefit in return (Trivers, 1971).

In his discussion of the precipitous decline of violence in seventeenth and eighteenth-century England, Pinker (2011) suggests that increases in the production (e.g. the introduction and development of the printing press) and consumption (e.g. increased literacy rates, more accessible literature) of forms of literature (e.g. journalism, memoir, fiction, history) prompted readers to adopt the perspective of the individuals discussed in print. This projection or increased perspective-taking, in turn, induced a state of sympathy, which increased the probability that in individual in a reading public would conduct altruistic behaviours on behalf of the individual or group described in the literature. This prediction is supported by historical data sets of efficiency in book production (Clark, 2007), numbers of books published (Simons, 2001), and literacy rates (Clark, 2007), which correlate with a decline in violence in seventeenth and eighteenth-century England. Additionally, the capacity for literacy to induce empathy is supported by experimental evidence using two versions of the Prisoner's Dilemma game. The first, a one-shot Prisoner's Dilemma, found that the rate of coop- erating jumped from 20 to 70% when participants read a personal note from an interactant (Batson and Moran, 1999). The second, an iterated Prisoner's Dilemma, found that only 5% percent of the interactants cooperated in response to a defection, while interactants who had read a personal note from another interactant beforehand cooperated 45% of the time (Batson and Ahmad, 2001).

Adults learning a foreign language often lack the breadth of exposure to the target language that a native speaker would have. Thus, they only partially learn the range of inflectional variants of a word, and omit morphological markers in their language production (Papadopoulou et al., 2011; Haznedar, 2006; Gurel, 2000). If non-native speakers represent a considerable part of the overall speaker population, they might drive the language towards morphological simplification."

Human language constitutes a uniquely cheap and flexible signalling device, allowing humans to engage in ‘cheap talk’ in an unprecedented range of circumstances. However, if words are easy and cost-free to produce, why should anyone believe what others say, and what is the incentive to learn thousands of words if one cannot be confident that any convey an accurate message? This constraint implies that researchers should favor theories that propose a context for the evolution of early language in which there was either no conflict of interest between the signaller and receiver, or one in which the reliability of the signals could easily be assessed (Szamado & Szathmary, 2006).

Such selective feedback would likely have made a big difference both to the scale of human cooperation that ensued, and to the potency of human language (Pagel, 2012), plausibly helping to explain how early language extended into domains in which honesty could not be assumed, and vigilance against malevolence or incompetence was required."

Recent experiments, however, showed that Japanese tits combine alert and recruitment calls into alertrecruitment sequences when attracting conspecifics to join in mobbing a predator. We speculate that such call combinations are favoured when: Firstly, callers and receivers have shared interests in exchanging information; secondly, species produce different types of calls in different situations, leading to distinct behavioural responses in receivers; and finally, complex situations exist in which receivers benefit by combining two or more behaviours. These preconditions were also present in human ancestors. Thus, future work on bird calls may provide insights into the evolution of compositional syntax in human language"""

This was also supported by a Skillings�Mack test on rankings; SI Appendix, S5). Whatever the precise position of shape in this ordering, it is nevertheless clear that this overall cross-linguistic hierarchy is not the widely presumed Aristotelian one. ... [However,] In fact, out of 20 languages, there are 13 unique rankings of perceptual domain by mean codability (Fig. 3). In Malay, for example, shape is the most codable of the senses on average and smell is the least codable, but in Umpila the exact opposite pat- tern holds�smell is the most codable and shape is the least. The attested unique rankings are fewer than would be expected by to- tally random sampling (permutation z = _6.5, P < 0.001), sug- gesting that the ranking of the senses is not entirely arbitrary,"

The position of smell has since been further demoted, based in part on insights regarding the evolutionary development of our senses, in which stereoscopic vision, wider eye orbits, and increasing vi- sual cortex have evolved at the expense of the olfactory bulb and olfactory epithelium (14�19). Modern reworkings of the Aristotelian hierarchy give primacy to sight followed by hear- ing, touch, and then taste and smell (20, 21). Regardless of the precise characterization, the distal senses of vision and audi- tion are privileged at the expense of the lowly proximal senses of touch, taste, and smell (22)."

It is tempting to suggest that larger communities with a higher likelihood for meeting strangers have a greater need for more specific vocabulary, while small communities can rely more on common ground and shared personal history. However, in our study, population size represents the number of speakers a language has globally, not the size of the community that was sampled. While the two measures are the same for small communities like Umpila or Kata Kolok, they are very different for global languages like English. The vari- able may instead be a proxy for level of industrialization. Indeed, population size increases significantly with complexity of subsistence type in our sample [Kruskal�Wallis _2 (4) = 12.0, P = 0.02]."

In Belyaev’s seminal farm fox experiment, it was shown that the function of the HPA axis was significantly reduced in domesticated foxes in just a few generations, resulting in decreased levels of glucocorticoids, decreased levels of basal adrenocorticotropic hormone in plasma, and reduced adrenal response to stress, which plausibly accounts for the changes in behavior linked to domestication (Naumenko and Belyaev, 1980; Oskina, 1996; Trut et al., 2009). A decreased stress response of the HPA axis was later found in other domesticated animals, like rats and guinea pigs (Kruska, 1988; Künzl and Sachser, 1999; Trut et al., 2009). Specifically, Kaiser et al. (2015) found that although cortisol levels in guinea pigs were similar in wild and domestic strains when it came to basal cortisol activity, the wild strain of cavies exhibited a more pronounced cortisol response when introduced to new environments (Künzl and Sachser, 1999; Künzl et al., 2003; Zipser et al., 2014). The HPA axis also plays a key role in the amygdala response and fear signaling impulses, which also contribute importantly to the behavioral phenotype of domesticated animals. "

We identify six domesticate names forming cognate sets with regular sound correspondences in at least two of the branches identified in our phylogenetic analysis: foxtail millet, pig, sheep, rice plant, cattle, and horse (SI Appendix, section 5). The fact that, archaeologically, all of these first appear in northern China, even those with cognate sets lacking a Chinese member, is a strong indication that, early in its expansion phase, the Sino-Tibetan family was located in that broad area (Fig. 1), now occupied by Sinitic languages. In particular, under our root date of ca. 7,200 yBP, broomcorn millet, foxtail millet, rice, pigs, and sheep are early enough to have played a demography-boosting role in the early stages of Sino-Tibetan expansion, although we do not think rice was known to ancestral Sino-Tibetan speakers. The northeastern part of the Sino-Tibetan domain is thus the family’s most likely homeland. Alternative proposals such as Sichuan (26), eastern India (16), and the Tibetan plateau (36) lack an archaeologically and demographically supported account of the family’s expansion."
