"group size","~","grooming",NA,"","cultural evolution","hypothesis",NA,"""there is a direct linear relationship between social group size and the amount of time devoted to social grooming.""","dunbar2017group"
"group size","<=>","social bonding",NA,"","cultural evolution","hypothesis",NA,"""With the progressive evolution of hominin community size to around 150 in modern humans, some novel means were necessary to allow time to be used more efficiently for social bonding so that larger groups could be evolved.""","dunbar2017group"
"laughter","^","group size",NA,"","cultural evolution","hypothesis",NA,"""Since grooming thus has an effective group size of one, laughter is three times more efficient than grooming in its capacity to bond individuals.""","dunbar2017group"

"laughter","~=","endorphins",NA,"","cultural evolution","hypothesis",NA,"""In other words, laughter triggers the endorphin system.""","dunbar2017group"
"singing","~=","endorphins",NA,"Singing","cultural evolution","hypothesis",NA,"""singing triggers the same endorphin mechanism as grooming and laughter, and at the same time increases the sense of belonging or social bonding.""","dunbar2017group"
"fire control",">","social interaction",NA,"","cultural evolution","hypothesis",NA,"""Sitting around a fire in the evening typically adds 4–5 h to the working day in the tropics for modern humans, and makes an even greater contribution at high latitudes where daylength in winter can be as short as 6–7 h.""","dunbar2017group"
"social interaction",">","group size",NA,"","cultural evolution","hypothesis",NA,"""However, the evening does lend itself to socialising: if the processes of social bonding can be shifted into these evening hours, it frees up the hours of daylight for food finding, solving at a stroke the whole of the time constraints crisis.""","dunbar2017group"
"storytelling",">","social interaction",NA,"","cultural evolution","hypothesis",NA,"""More importantly, stories play a crucial role in community bonding by creating a sense of belonging to a community through the transmission of a common culture. Indeed, they are the major means by which we do this.""","dunbar2017group"
"group size","^","language",NA,"","cultural evolution","hypothesis",NA,"""In this new context of fireside socialising, language has the important additional advantage that it allows us to tell stories and jokes. Jokes allow us to control the frequency of laughter, and to keep it going in a context where it would naturally die once the slapstick event that had triggered it has passed. More importantly, stories play a crucial role in community bonding by creating a sense of belonging to a community through the transmission of a common culture.""","dunbar2017group"
