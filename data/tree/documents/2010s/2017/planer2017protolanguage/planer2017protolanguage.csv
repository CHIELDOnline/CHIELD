As I will use the term, an individual will be said to possess an informational theory of mind when she (a) is capable of attributing goal states to others; (b) is capable of attributing informationcarrying states to others; and (c) has some understanding of how the latter states interact with one another as well as with goal states so as to generate behavior.""","planer2017protolanguage"

By this I have in mind the ability to bring together a variety of information (e.g., spatial, temporal, causal, etc.) into a single, coherent mental representation of a particular situation.""","planer2017protolanguage"
"imitation: interpersonal acts",">","lexicon","","","preadaptation","hypothesis","","""Imitation of interpersonal acts. This is an ability to reproduce acts which have been performed by others towards oneself or which others have performed unto others. So, to give a simple example, suppose I place your hand on my back so as to elicit back-scratching behavior from you. Imitation of this act on your part would thus consist in you placing my hand on your back so as to elicit back-scratching behavior from me, or placing the hand of some third party on your back so as to elicit back-scratching behavior from them.""","planer2017protolanguage"
