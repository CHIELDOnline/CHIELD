"modality",">","iconicity","none","","coevolution","experiment","no","We have shown that conventionalisation, as a process for arbitrary forms to 581 emerge, may not work in the same way or as quickly with different modalities. We found 582 no evidence that signals in our experiment became more conventionalised (simpler and 583 less iconic) through interaction or repetition. We hypothesise that when iconicity is 584 difficult in a modality, iconicity needs to emerge over a period of negotiation to gain 585 transparent, mutually intelligible signals. It is only when a signal is grounded for more 586 than one person that it can then be separated in form from its meaning and become more 587 arbitrary.","little2017conventionalisation"
