"bipedalism",">","social tracking","","","","hypothesis","","""The social trackways theory... is centered on the remarkable 3.66 mya Laetoli Fossilized Trackways, for they incontrovertibly reveal our ancestors were already obligate bipeds with very human-like feet, and were intentionally stepping in other band members’ footprints to maintain safe footing. Trackways are unique among natural sign systems in possessing a depictive nar- ratively generative structure, somewhat like the symbolic sign systems of gestural languages.""","shaw2017social"

They began mentally representing them- selves (and others) as intentional agents continuously trav- elling from the past into the future.""","shaw2017social"

Unsurprisingly then, given the remarkable mnemonic efficiency of spoken words and phrases when used as conventional signs (names or “trail markers”) for important places, characters, and action- events, and the extra, more dependable nutrition available from cooked food and dried/smoke-preserved animal flesh, the final surge in encephalization in our lineage was both relatively large and of short duration""","shaw2017social"
