"theory of mind: informational",">","lexicon",NA,"","preadaptation","hypothesis",NA,"""An informational theory of mind: By this, I am referring to an ability to mentally represent other agents as possessing certain information-carrying states as well as states that specify an environmental condition that the agent is motivated to bring about. In addition, as I use the term, it is assumed that possession of an informational theory of mind involves some grasp of the way in which these two types of states can interact with one another, for example, that seeing a predator over there can create in the perceiver a goal to hide.""","planer2017talking"
"imitation: interpersonal acts",">","lexicon",NA,"","preadaptation","hypothesis",NA,"""Imitation of interpersonal acts: This refers to the ability to imitate acts which others have performed either towards oneself or which one has seen performed towards third parties. For example, suppose you hold your hand out towards me so as to prompt food-giving behavior from me. Imitation of your act on my part would thus consist in my holding out my hand towards you so as to prompt foodgiving behavior from you in the future, or my holding out my hand towards some third party so as to elicit this reaction from that individual.""","planer2017talking"

"theory of mind: informational",">","teaching",NA,"","coevolution","hypothesis",NA,"""The suggestion, then, is that the existence of instructed learning at this stage [~1.5 mya] constitutes evidence for an increased understanding of others as intentional agents relative to that which was present in our last common ancestor with chimpanzees. In particular, I think it points to a deeper awareness of the information that is possessed by other individuals (others come to be seen as information repositories), including but not limited to the skills they possess. If instructed learning played as important a role in the lives of these hominins as the evidence suggests it did, then there would have been strong selection pressure for teaching only those who were in fact ignorant or misinformed and for seeking guidance only from those who in fact possessed the relevant information""","planer2017talking"
"teaching",">","tool making",NA,"","coevolution","hypothesis",NA,"""Archaeological evidence strongly suggests that Acheulean-age technology, if not that of the developed Oldowan, depended critically upon instructed learning. The information that was reliably transmitted was multifaceted. As early as 1.5 mya, we find tools that reflect truly expert knapping abilities. Handaxes from this period are bifacially flaked and symmetrical along multiple axes. As Peter Hiscock (2014) has argued, such know-how is extremely unlikely to be the product of observational learning alone.""","planer2017talking"
"imitation: interpersonal acts",">","quarrying behaviour",NA,"","coevolution","hypothesis",NA,"""I contend that recent experimental work reproducing the quarrying behavior of Acheulean hominins in India (Petraglia et al. 2005; Shipton et al. 2009a, b) provides us with at least some reason for thinking that early Pleistocene hominins possessed the ability to imitate interpersonal acts""","planer2017talking"
"mental models",">","lexicon",NA,"","preadaptation","hypothesis",NA,"""Mental-model construction: This refers to the ability to construct multifaceted mental representations of particular situations. By “multifaceted,” it is here meant that the representations integrate several different kinds of information (e.g., spatial, temporal, causal, etc.).""","planer2017talking"
"mental models",">","economy of material procurement",NA,"","coevolution","hypothesis",NA,"""Debitage patterns reveal that raw materials that had to be imported over long distances—and so had high import costs—were used much more efficiently than materials with low import costs (Reti 2013). Thus, these hominins apparently understood that some raw materials were more valuable than others, and acting accordingly, treating high-quality material with much greater care. (It is also reasonable to imagine that the distribution of raw material to individual knappers tracked skill level, with high-quality material being reserved for more expert individuals.) In addition, these hominins concentrated knappable stone at particular locations within their landscape, a fact which some archeologists see as evidence for “strategic caching” of butchery sites (Potts 1991). The idea here is that storage of lithic resources at locations where carcasses could be safely butchered would have obviated the need to transport carcasses to quarry sites. If right, this would demonstrate an ability on the part of these hominins to think about future situations and to take laborious actions in the present that see to the satisfaction of future needs""","planer2017talking"
"mental models",">","tool making",NA,"","coevolution","hypothesis",NA,"""There is an important sense in which each core is a unique entity unto itself: as knapping proceeds, the knapper will often be confronted with challenges necessitating novel reduction strategies. The skillful navigation of these problems requires the bringing together of a wide range of information: one must probe memory for past situations that bear a useful resemblance to the present one; one must make predictions about the likely outcome of various interventions on the core; one must understand the causal properties of both the core and the hammerstone which differ with the size, shape, and type of material; one must understand how each of these interventions will transform the problem space at the next time step; the list goes on. Moreover, in order for skill level to increase with practice, one must be able to learn from one’s mistakes—to understand why things didn’t go as planned—requiring powers of retrodiction. In short, it is very hard to see how expert knapping would be possible in the absence of an ability to construct rich mental models""","planer2017talking"
