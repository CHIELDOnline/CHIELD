"sound segmentation",">","sound recombination","none","","none","","none","the segmentation of sound enables recombination to happen, reconstructing learned sounds in a different order","garland2017song"
"sound recombination",">","song evolution","none","","none","experiment","none","The novel sound recombination causes a change in the song, therefore it evolves","garland2017song"
"sound segmentation",">","vocal learning","none","","none","review","none","vocal learning is dependant on the ability to break down sounds into their component parts","garland2017song"
"learning mechanisms",">","vocal learning","none","","none","review","none","vocal learning is only possible if there are the correct learning mechanisms to support it","garland2017song"

"vocal learning",">","cultural transmission","none","","none","experiment","none","vocalisations allow individuals to transmit cultural knowledge to each other","garland2017song"
"cultural transmission",">","song evolution","none","","none","experiment","none","when different whale populations with different songs come into contact with each other, they learn new songs from each other and thus their song evolves","garland2017song"
