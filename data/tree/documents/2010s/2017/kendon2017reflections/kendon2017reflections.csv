I conclude that language must have evolved in the oral–aural and kinesic modalities together, with neither modality taking precedence over the other.""","kendon2017reflections"
"social complexity",">","gesture","","","preadaptation","hypothesis","","""more complex social systems will require members to employ more complex communication systems. That is, there will be a wider and more diverse repertoire of communicative signals, both vocal and visible, in societies that are larger, have differentiated social roles and more complex interaction networks, and include maintained pair relationships (as between mates, but also long-term friend relationships), than in societies that have fewer of these features. This means, of course, that any evolutionary account of human language will have to take account of the evolution of social complexity in the species to be considered.""","kendon2017reflections"
