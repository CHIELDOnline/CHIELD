These results debunk the myth of high borrowing in huntergatherer languages and suggest that the evolution of these languages is governed by the same type of rules as those operating in largescale agriculturalist speech communities. The results also show that local factors are likely to be more critical than general processes in determining high (or low) loan rates.""","bowern2011does"
