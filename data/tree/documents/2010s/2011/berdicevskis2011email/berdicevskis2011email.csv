"interlocutor involvement",">","emoticons","pos","online communication","language change","hypothesis","","Emoticons are more numerous in chat, since in a synchronous mode it is more important to show a “polite smile” to an interlocutor. They also have a phatic function: you are showing that you are interested in what your partner is saying, and you might reply to a message with a single smiling emoticon if you do not have anything else to say.","berdicevskis2011email"
