degree of shared information,^,phonemic complexity,pos,phonology; sociolinguistics,language change,review,,"A large fund of communally shared knowl- edge would have made for a situation in which communication with a relatively low level of phonological redundancy would have been relatively tolerable; and a community consisting entirely of native speakers exposed to the language from infancy would have had no problem with memory load. This would have permitted the development of small phoneme inventories, though of course it would not have compelled such a development.",trudgill2011social
