"lexicon: frequency of use",">","lexicon: information content","pos",NA,"language change","statistical","none","People's expectations about upcoming words are influenced by word frequency, even controlling for information content and other relevant factors (Demberg & Keller 2008). This means that a communication system which is optimal for people's probabilistic expectations may include frequency effects. Alternatively, the frequency effects might be illusory: a model of information content that takes into account more than N-gram contexts—for instance, global discourse context or world knowledge—may explain all the variance frequency explains.","piantadosi2011word"
"lexicon: frequency of use","/>","word length","neg",NA,"language change","statistical","none","In several languages, the partial correlation of frequency is close to zero, meaning that the effect of frequency is largely a result of the fact that it is correlated with information content. In most languages, the partial correlation of length with information content, controlling for frequency, is larger even than the absolute correlation between length and frequency.","piantadosi2011word"
