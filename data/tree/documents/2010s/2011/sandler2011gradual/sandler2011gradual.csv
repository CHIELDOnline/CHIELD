"minimal pairs","/>","al-sayyid bedouin sign language","","","cultural evolution","","","""The first red flag we noticed is a dearth of minimal pairs in our data"" p. 524","sandler2011gradual"
"formational constraints","/>","al-sayyid bedouin sign language","","","cultural evolution","","","""The second form of evidence is in the more glaring violation of general sign language formational constraints than we expected from familiarity with more established sign languages"" p. 524","sandler2011gradual"
"convergence on signs","/>","al-sayyid bedouin sign language","","","cultural evolution","","","""The third observation that led us to question the existence of a phonological system is the amount of variation in sign production across signers"" p. 524","sandler2011gradual"

"vocabulary size",">","phonology","","","cultural evolution","","","""Pinpointing the kernels of phonology in this way may be informative for the evolution of phonology more generally... Our findings suggest that alongside Hockett's requirement of a significantly large vocabulary, a key ingredient in creating a phonological system is conventionalization"" p. 526","sandler2011gradual"

"assimilation",">","phonology","","","cultural evolution","","","""As in any language, assimilation provides an important clue to the existence and nature of those meaningless formational elements, and, in the case at hand, a clue to the emergence of phonology"" p. 534","sandler2011gradual"

"formal reorganisation",">","phonology","","","cultural evolution","","","""We propose that conventionalization among signers, and the automaticity and redundancy that go with it, underlie the emergence of a meaningless formal level of structure in the language of a community"" p. 537","sandler2011gradual"

"ease of articulation",">","formal reorganisation","","","cultural evolution","","","""As a particular sign becomes concentionalized, attention to the form-meaning correspondence is reduced, and the formational elements themselves re-organize, under cognitive and motoric pressures for ease of articulation, formal symmetry, and the like"" p. 537","sandler2011gradual"

"phonology","/>","syntax","","","cultural evolution","","","""Apparently, it is not the case that phonology must precede syntax, at least for a sign language. But could spoken languages have arisen without duality? ... It is certainly conceivable that early humans were able to store a much larger number of distinct holistic signals than vervet monkeys, and might have created syntactic combinations with those"" p. 538","sandler2011gradual"
