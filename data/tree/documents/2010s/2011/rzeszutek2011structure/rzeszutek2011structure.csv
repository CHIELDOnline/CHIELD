In particular, we do not see a strong musical division between populations speaking Formosan languages (spoken exclusively in mainland Taiwan) and Western Malayo-Polynesian languages, spoken by populations on Orchid Island and in the northern Philippines. Instead, we see the Luzon tribes being interspersed with several of the southern Taiwanese tribes, in particular the Paiwan and Rukai. Moreover, these latter two tribes show far more relatedness to one another musically than is predicted based on linguistic analyses [6]. Therefore, the musical relationships among these tribes might be quite different than those based on language, regardless of the low proportion of between-population diversity found in the musical data""","rzeszutek2011structure"
