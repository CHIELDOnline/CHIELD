Instead, I focus here on human syntactic abilities as one important difference between our species and other species that needs to be explained... But other differences, for example in the social cognition involved in semantics and pragmatics... and vocal learning... also needed to evolve after hominins diverged from our last common ancestor with chimpanzees around six million years ago. Syntactic abilities are important, and will be my focus here, but are not the only factor underlying language in our species""","fitch2018animals"
