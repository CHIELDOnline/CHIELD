"sensory domain",">","codability","","","language change","experiment","","perceptual domains differed in codability (_2 = 27.8, P < 0.001). � If you seek a single hierarchy of the senses that generalizes over the whole language sample using a decision tree (clustering) with random effects for language and stimulus type, the following order emerges (from most to least codable): [color, taste] > [shape, sound, touch] > smell, and a permutation test confirmed the same broad pattern: [color, taste] > shape > [sound, touch] > smell (SI Appendix, S4. This was also supported by a Skillings�Mack test on rankings; SI Appendix, S5). Whatever the precise position of shape in this ordering, it is nevertheless clear that this overall cross-linguistic hierarchy is not the widely presumed Aristotelian one. ... [However,] In fact, out of 20 languages, there are 13 unique rankings of perceptual domain by mean codability (Fig. 3). In Malay, for example, shape is the most codable of the senses on average and smell is the least codable, but in Umpila the exact opposite pat- tern holds�smell is the most codable and shape is the least. The attested unique rankings are fewer than would be expected by to- tally random sampling (permutation z = _6.5, P < 0.001), sug- gesting that the ranking of the senses is not entirely arbitrary,","majid2018differential"
"sensory domain",">","codability","","","language change","review","","Since Aristotle, it has been supposed that there is a hierar- chy of the senses, with sight as the dominant sense, followed by hearing, smell, touch, and taste (13), opening the possibility that some aspects of perception are intrinsically more acces- sible to consciousness and thus to language. The position of smell has since been further demoted, based in part on insights regarding the evolutionary development of our senses, in which stereoscopic vision, wider eye orbits, and increasing vi- sual cortex have evolved at the expense of the olfactory bulb and olfactory epithelium (14�19). Modern reworkings of the Aristotelian hierarchy give primacy to sight followed by hear- ing, touch, and then taste and smell (20, 21). Regardless of the precise characterization, the distal senses of vision and audi- tion are privileged at the expense of the lowly proximal senses of touch, taste, and smell (22).","majid2018differential"
"communicative needs",">","codability","pos","","language change","review","","The long-standing presumption in Western thought has been that vision and audition are more objective than the other senses, serving as the basis of knowledge and understanding, whereas touch, taste, and smell are crude and of little value. This predicts that humans ought to be better at communicating about sight and hearing than the other senses, and decades of work based on English and related languages certainly suggests this is true. ","majid2018differential"
"population size",">","communicative needs","","","language change","statistical","","speakers of languages with a greater number of speakers [estimates from source (53)] had higher agreement across all domains (for a population of 100, estimated mean codability M = 0.14; for a population of 1 million, M = 0.24; P = 0.03), a non�self-evident result. ... It is tempting to suggest that larger communities with a higher likelihood for meeting strangers have a greater need for more specific vocabulary, while small communities can rely more on common ground and shared personal history. However, in our study, population size represents the number of speakers a language has globally, not the size of the community that was sampled. While the two measures are the same for small communities like Umpila or Kata Kolok, they are very different for global languages like English. The vari- able may instead be a proxy for level of industrialization. Indeed, population size increases significantly with complexity of subsistence type in our sample [Kruskal�Wallis _2 (4) = 12.0, P = 0.02].","majid2018differential"

"communicative needs: smell",">","codability","pos","","language change","review","","Many scholars, for example, have opined that no language will have a developed lexicon for smell (23�28). This presumption has been challenged by cross-cultural investigations showing that while English-speakers may indeed display the oft-touted visual domi- nance, other cultures show a different picture altogether (29). For example, the Jahai�a hunter-gatherer community residing in the rainforests of the Malay Peninsula�find odors just as easy to express as visual entities (30). ","majid2018differential"

"education",">","codability","pos","","language change","statistical","","There was a marginal effect of the level of formal education available in the community too: cod- ability was higher with more formal education (high formal schooling availability, M = 0.48, low availability, M = 0.29; P = 0.057).

"deafness",">","codability","pos","","language change","experiment","no","it is widely held that there is a trade-off between the senses, such that loss of one per- ceptual sense leads to heightened abilities in the other senses (46). This might predict that sign languages would show higher codability for nonauditory modalities. To assess whether signed languages clustered together, we used regression trees with random effects for each stimulus (47) to predict codability by language, domain, and modality. There were no simple generalizations that classified signed languages as distinct from spoken languages; that is, mo- dality of language did not predict codability ","majid2018differential"
"word length","~","codability","neg","","language change","experiment","","in their groundbreaking work, Brown and Lenneberg (34) identified the most codable stimuli as those with the highest interspeaker agreement, and also the shortest descriptors. In our study, more codable stimuli within each language received shorter descriptions on average (r = _0.18, GAM model P < 0.001; SI Appendix, S4), although there was a �sweet spot�: very short re- sponses were associated with less codable stimuli. This may reflect a balance between a cognitive bias for efficient communication (short labels), on the one hand, and a bias for informativeness (distinct labels), on the other (48, 49).

"concreteness","~","codability","pos","","language change","experiment","","As expected, if a group of speakers were more likely to use abstract terms to refer to a domain, then the codability of that domain was also higher (r = 0.34, _2 = 15.0, P < 0.001; Fig. 4A). ","majid2018differential"
"sensory domain","~","concreteness","","","language change","experiment","","Compared with color, other domains were relatively more likely to elicit evaluative descriptions (all P < 0.005), except for shapes, which elicited proportionately more source-based de- scriptions (all P < 0.01). Smell was significantly more likely to elicit evaluative descriptions than other domains (P < 0.005), consistent with the idea that odor is predominantly distinguished along hedonic lines (57, 58). Only sound was more likely to elicit abstract descriptions than color (P < 0.005), but it notably de- parted from color and other perceptual domains in predomi- nantly recruiting metaphor for expression.
