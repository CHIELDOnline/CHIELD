"role assignment: case marking","~=","redundancy","pos","","","","","In languages with relatively fixed word order, grammatical role assignment can usually be inferred based on word order alone, ren- dering case marking redundant.","roberts2018social"
"role assignment: word order","~=","redundancy","pos","","","","","In flexible-word-order languages, however, case provides important information about sentence meaning, as word order is less informative of grammatical role assignment.","roberts2018social"
"role assignment: case marking","<=>","role assignment: word order","neg","","","","","The trade-off between cues to grammatical role assignment has been argued to stem from a trade-off between robust message transmission – the speaker’s goal to be understood – and production effort (Fedzechkina, Jaeger, & Newport, 2012, 2016; Kurumada & Jaeger, 2015).","roberts2018social"
