"symbolic thinking",">","reproductive success","pos","","preadaptation","hypothesis","","We hypothesize that the individuals who were able to transform symbolic thinking into sensory stimuli —likely privileged in the society— may have had a higher rate of reproductive success, thus spreadingthe cognitive ability required for this practice through the population.

"FOXP2 mutation",">","symbolic thinking","pos","","preadaptation","review","","The FOXP2 gene is implicated for speech in humans and for other externalized communication forms in mice (Groszer et al., 2008; Castellucci et al., 2016; Chabout et al., 2016) and songbirds (Haesler et al., 2007), but only modern humans have art and language.","miyagawa2018cross"

"rock art","~=","language","pos","","coevolution","hypothesis","","We also suggest that the earliest rock art found in Africa may constitute one of the ﬁrst fossilized proxies for the expression of full-ﬂedged human linguistic behavior.","miyagawa2018cross"
"cave art","~=","language","pos","","coevolution","hypothesis","","We argue that cave art is a form of cross-modality information transfer, in which acoustic signals are transformed into symbolic visual representations. This form of information transfer across modalities is an instance of how the symbolic mind of early modern humans was taking shape into concrete, externalized language.","miyagawa2018cross"
