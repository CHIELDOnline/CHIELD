"shared goals",">","combinatorial structure","","","coevolution","hypothesis","","""We hypothesize that compositional syntax should evolve in species where individuals firstly, evolved a certain level of shared interest; secondly, evolved multiple meaningful calls; and finally, have a need to communicate combined messages that require receivers to exhibit two behaviours together""; ""Compositional syntax, where lexical items are combined into larger units, has been assumed to be unique to human language. Recent experiments, however, showed that Japanese tits combine alert and recruitment calls into alertrecruitment sequences when attracting conspecifics to join in mobbing a predator. We speculate that such call combinations are favoured when: Firstly, callers and receivers have shared interests in exchanging information; secondly, species produce different types of calls in different situations, leading to distinct behavioural responses in receivers; and finally, complex situations exist in which receivers benefit by combining two or more behaviours. These preconditions were also present in human ancestors. Thus, future work on bird calls may provide insights into the evolution of compositional syntax in human language""","griesser2018bird"

Thus, grammatical rules efficiently expand the number of possible meaningful phrases from a limited set of units. The evolution of such rules should be promoted when a large number of messages are required and there are production and/or cognitive constraints on the number of meaningful units""","griesser2018bird"
