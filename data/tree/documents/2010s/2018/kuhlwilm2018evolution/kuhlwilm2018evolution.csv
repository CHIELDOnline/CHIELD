"gene: FOXP2",">","cognition: human","","","preadaptation","hypothesis","","""Evolutionary changes in the genomic region of FOXP2 have been studied extensively. The functional consequences of changes in this gene — and larger networks in which it is embedded — might have contributed to human-specific cognitive and behavioral traits""; ""FOXP2 is an important focal point for the evolution of cognitive traits that might have contributed to the human phenotype, with functionally important differences since the split from chimpanzees. The observation of a large desert of introgression from archaic hominins into humans around the genomic region of FOXP2 strongly suggests that the archaic haplotype was not well tolerated in modern humans. The complex regulatory surrounding and human-specific changes within the region need to be better understood to determine the mechanism of this incompatibility. However, introgressed fragments are observed in this genomic region in other populations, pointing to a particular modern human phenomenon of stark depletion.""","kuhlwilm2018evolution"

"genes",">","cognition: human","","","preadaptation","hypothesis","","""Although humans and extinct archaic lineages share protein-altering changes in FOXP2 since the split from chimpanzees, other subsequent human-specific single nucleotide changes might have facilitated recent modern human traits. Recently, high-coverage genomes of archaic individuals allowed an assessment of the distribution of archaic hominin ancestry after their admixture with humans, revealing parts of the genome that are depleted for introgressed genetic material. One of the largest deserts of admixture encompasses FOXP2, suggesting incompatibilities between modern humans and other Homo lineages due to functional differences. No such desert is found around FOXP2 in other admixture events.""","kuhlwilm2018evolution"
