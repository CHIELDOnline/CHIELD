"population size",">","lexicon:rate of change","pos","","language change","model","none","""...evolution proceeds faster in large populations. At first sight, this may seem paradox: population size is predicted to increase the stability of an item, but at the same time population size drives linguistic optimization, where an item is effectively replaced by a more successful version of itself. Note, crucially, that the more optimized variant is less likely to get lost.""","baumann2018linguistic"
"spatial heterogeneity",">","variation in learning sets","pos","","language change","model","none","""The model builds on the assumption that the learning process depends on a mass-action law (i.e., interactions are proportional with the product of the number of learners and users). It has been pointed out (de Jong, Diekmann, & Heesterbeek, 1996), that this assumption does not hold in large populations in realistic ecological scenarios. Consequently, the effect of population size on the basic reproductive ratio is probably overestimated as populations become larger.""","baumann2018linguistic"
