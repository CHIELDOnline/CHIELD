"domain-general neural networks","/>","syntax","","","preadaptation","","","""In our view, syntactic processing is the only plausible domain-specific aspect of language processing, and the syntax system can be differentiated both from the wider language system (including domain-general components responsible for semantics and pragmatics) and from broader domain-general networks."" p. 132; ""First, we know that these domain-general systems cannot compensate for syntactic processes carried out by the left-lateralized frontotemporal syntax system since they do not appear to be recruited when the left hemisphere frontotemporal syntax system is impaired following brain damage... Second, damage to domain-general networks does not lead to aphasia, though it may lead to language impairments which are limited to situations which tax these domain-general systems and the processes they subserve"" p. 135","campbell2018language"
"domain-general neural networks",">","domain-specific system","","","preadaptation","","","""The phylogeny of the domain-specific aspects of human language remain unknown, although there are a range of hypotheses about their genesis, from the idea that they arose through a genetic mutation... to the neuroconstructivist view... that evolution may be driven primar-ily by increased plasticity for learning, such that domain-specific systems emerge over developmental time from an interaction between domain-general learning mechanisms and exposure to human language"" p. 135","campbell2018language"
"syntactical abilities",">","syntax","","","preadaptation","","","""Defining the extent to which syntax is domain-specific has recently become important in the context of investigating the evolutionary precursors to human language.This research is based on the premise that the core aspect of human language processing is the construction of hierarchical syntactic structures, and tests this hypothesis by comparing the sensitivity of humans and macaques to different kinds of sequence learning — ranging from simple adjacency relationships which are not expected to show species differences — to hierarchical syntactic structures which are. The results of these studies support the claim that both humans and non-human primates are sensitive to simple adjacency relationships whereas only humans are able to construct hierarchical syntactic structures"" p. 135","campbell2018language"
"domain-specific system",">","syntactical abilities","","","preadaptation","","","""In this paper, we present a novel, data-driven approach for isolating the domain-specific syntax system and argue that natural syntactic processing does not require domain-general input, even when it is ‘difficult’ due to, for instance, temporary syntactic ambiguity"" p. 132","campbell2018language"

"domain-general neural networks",">","language","","","preadaptation","","","""In addition, processing language under difficult conditions such as noisy environments... or within the context of a task... can spontaneously recruit broad domain-general networks. However, these differ from the domain-general networks of semantics and pragmatics.While the latter are key components of the broader language system and likely interact with each other and syntax during the processing of natural language... domain-general systems such as attention and memory are not required for language comprehension and do not penetrate the domain-specific syntax system"" pp. 135-136","campbell2018language"
