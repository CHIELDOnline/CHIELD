Therefore, we think it is overwhelmingly likely that Neanderthals were as much articulate beings as we ourselves are, that is, with large vocabularies and combinatorial structures that allowed propositional content and illocutionary force to be conveyed. Only such an advanced communication system could have carried the advanced cultural adaptations that Neanderthals exhibited.""","dediu2018neanderthal"

They inhabited a climatic range (from Arctic to Mediterranean) requiring the extended ability to use culture as a buffer for ecological adaptation, and they interacted repeatedly with AMH over tens of thousands of years, exchanging genes, parasites and culture.""","dediu2018neanderthal"
