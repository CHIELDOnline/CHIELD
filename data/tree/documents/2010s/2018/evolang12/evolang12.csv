"pragmatic agent",">","communication","","","cultural evolution","hypothesis","","selection pressure for communication and perspective inference lead to similar levels of informativeness, and hence similar (high) levels of success at both communicating and inferring perspectives. This is because pragmatic agents can reach high levels of communicative success even with suboptimal languages, while both communication and inferring perspectives still rely on the language being somewhat informative.","evolang12"
