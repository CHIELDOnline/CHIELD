Instead, it explained by far the largest fraction of the linguistic differences between the municipal dialects... but the vast majority of this fraction was also explained by administrative distance... The large role of geographical distance at the municipal level is also seen as a highly significant positive spatial autocorrelation of all the dependent and explanatory variables remaining in the final model, especially within the range of 100 km.""","honkola18"
"environmental differences",">","dialect divergence","pos","","language change","statistical","yes","""Environmental differences alone explained the second largest fraction of the linguistic differences at both levels: ca. 11 % of the differences between the dialect groups... and 6 % of differences between the municipal dialects... Large and moderate differences in the environmental conditions predicted linguistic differences well at the dialect group level as well as at the municipal dialect level, while small differences in the environmental conditions were poor predictors of linguistic difference between the municipal dialects.""","honkola18"
