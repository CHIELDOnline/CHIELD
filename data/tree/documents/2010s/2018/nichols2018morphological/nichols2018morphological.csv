"morphological complexity","~=","word entropy","pos","","none","hypothesis","none","""The third measure used here is word entropy, more precisely the entropy of unigrams, i.e., runs of alphanumeric UTF8 characters delimited by white spaces. [...] The bottom line is that a language with high morphological complexity, i.e., very productive morphological marking strategies, has a wide range of word forms, higher word unpredictability, and hence higher entropy—as a general trend"" (Nichols & Bentz 2018: 15-16).","nichols2018morphological"

Rather, it is the greater sociolinguistic isolation of highland villages that accounts for the greater complexity of their languages (Nichols 2013, 2016). These villages—difficult of access, distant from markets, with short growing seasons, and almost entirely endogamous—receive almost no immigrants and therefore almost no L2 learners, and it is intake of L2 learners that most clearly tends to decomplexify languages (Dahl 2004; McWhorter 2007, 2016; Lupyan and Dale 2010; Trudgill 2011; Bentz and Winter 2013; Bentz et al. 2015; Bentz and Berdicevskis 2016)"" (Nichols & Bentz 2018: 18).","nichols2018morphological"
"longitude",">","inventory complexity","pos","","none","statistical","none","""Figure 5 shows overall levels of inventory complexity (Autotyp-based) for 193 languages surveyed worldwide. In the high latitudes (above 40° N) there is a fairly strong correlation of complexity and longitude (r = 0.42, p < 0.001): complexity levels are low in western Europe and increase to high in eastern North America. The mid and low latitudes of the northern hemisphere show a very similar correlation (r = 0.42, p < 0.01), while for the southern continents (Africa, Australia-New Guinea-Oceania, South America) this is considerably reduced and nonsignificant (r = 0.19, p = 0.25). Note that this reduction and non-significance is not due to smaller sample size (N = 82, compared to N = 65, and N = 45). The longitude/complexity relationship is then a mainly northern phenomenon, and it links the entire high-latitude northern hemisphere in a single typological trend. The cline obtains within Eurasia, as seems to be in line with the deep connections posited by Jäger (2015) based on lexical similarity, but continues beyond into North America. However, we would connect differences in complexity to sociolinguistics more than to common descent"" (Nichols & Bentz 2018: 21).","nichols2018morphological"

""Subsequently, probably beginning only with the Neolithic, complexity levels were reduced in much of the Old World as complex societies and states expanded and trade languages formed, spreading languages to L2 learners. Highland languages, such as the ones surveyed here in the Andean region of South America, might have a) complexified in sociolinguistic isolation, or b) reverted to the earlier and probably default situation (Bickel and Nichols 2003)—or both. Furthermore, in the Americas, the same processes as observed in Eurasia occur independently (at least pre-contact): statehood lowers complexity levels (in Central America and the Andes) compared to more isolated, agricultural highland languages"" (Nichols & Bentz 2018: 23).","nichols2018morphological"
