"prosociality",">","alliances","pos","","coevolution","experiment","none","It was shown that prosocial individuals are intrinsically motivated to cooperate, and the main determinants of trust for them are extraneous social cues signaling the trustworthiness of their interaction partner (Bogaert et al., 2008). Gossip is rich in social information and might create transparency by revealing reputation information about others. It has been shown that prosocially oriented people use reputation gossip concerning the wrongdoings of others to warn about potential free-riders (Feinberg et al., 2012). Therefore, we hypothesize that celebrity gossip will increase trust of prosocial individuals (H1). Conversely, proselfs do not seek trust signals but situations with ambiguous social information that offer more opportunities to exploit others (Boone et al., 2010). Therefore, we hypothesize that celebrity gossip will decrease trust of proself individuals (H2). ","rudnicki2012evolang12"
