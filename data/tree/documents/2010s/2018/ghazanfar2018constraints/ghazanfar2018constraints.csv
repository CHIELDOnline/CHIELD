"cooperation",">","cooperative reproduction","","","coevolution","hypothesis","","""In the evolution of human communication, a key transition occurred when humans began to interact cooperatively... Care of infants is probably the most important context in which cooperation with unrelated individuals occurs, and there is a strong correlation between the reproductive success of mothers and the amount of infant care provided by others""","ghazanfar2018constraints"

"cooperative reproduction",">","infant vocalizations","","","coevolution","hypothesis","","""When caregiver attention is a limited resource, and when non-maternal caregivers may have higher threshold than mothers to provide care, evolution may select for vocal behaviors that help infants attract attention... Babbling and other infant vocalizations attract caregivers and trigger contingent responses from them. It is been suggested that infant babbling evolved to exploit auditory predispositions in adult receivers""","ghazanfar2018constraints"

"infant vocalizations","<=>","vocal learning","","","coevolution","hypothesis","","""The fact that parents of both human and marmoset infants are more likely to give contingent responses to infant vocalizations when those vocalizations sound more adult-like is consistent with this ‘receiver predisposition’ idea... This suggests that a vocal learning mechanism may have evolved to speed up the production of mature-sounding vocalizations (i.e., those that exploit the receiver predispositions) using social feedback because such vocalizations are more likely to elicit caregiver attention.","ghazanfar2018constraints"
