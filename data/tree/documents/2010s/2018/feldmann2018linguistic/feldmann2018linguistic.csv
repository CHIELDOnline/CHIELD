"pronoun drop",">","social context embedding","pos","","language change","review","","In languages requiring its speakers to mention the subject pronoun explicitly, the person is highlighted as a figure against the context of the speech (Kashima and Kashima 1998). This entails a psychological differentiation between the subject and the context, and a focus on the former. ... dropping a personal pronoun as the subject of a sentence symbolically de-emphasizes the significance of the relevant individual. He is symbolically represented as being embedded in the context.","feldmann2018linguistic"
"social context embedding",">","individualism","neg","","language change","review","","Languages that allow speakers to drop a personal pronoun when used as a subject of a sentence may entrench not only the belief that individuals are embedded in social contexts, but also that they need to submit themselves to the collective. The interests of the collective may be regarded as more important than those of the individual. In the distant past, the custom to drop personal pronouns, especially � I � , may have reflected and enshrined cultural traditions that gave more emphasis to the collective � society and the extended family � than the individual. Thus, pronoun drop languages may have perpetuated such collectivist traditions.","feldmann2018linguistic"
"individualism",">","investment in child education: state","pos","","language change","review","","pronoun drop languages may help to entrench the primacy of the collective � the extended family or society at large � over the individual. Under such circumstances, both governments and parents may be inclined to invest relatively little into children� s education (Hofstede 2001, Schwartz 2008). Governments may tend to do so for two reasons in particular. First, they may view the education of children primarily as the continued responsibility of the extended family. Second, they may want to avoid as much as possible that well-educated individuals become independent of the state and, in particular, that they emigrate.","feldmann2018linguistic"

In collectivist societies, their education is generally seen as less important than the education of boys. Additionally, the advancement of girls is usually seen as more of a threat to the extended family because females are expected to bear the bulk of the burden when it comes to caring for elderly family members.","feldmann2018linguistic"
