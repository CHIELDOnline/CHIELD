"communication with non-native speakers",">","adjustment of speech","pos","Linguistics","language change","review","yes","'It is well documented that people accommodate their speech when they interact with NNS by simplifying their speech, avoiding local variants, widening their vowel space, slowing down their speech, and so forth (Barbu, Martin, & Chevrot, 2014; Biersack, Kempe, & Knapton, 2005; Long, 1983; Uther, Knoll, & Burnham, 2007)'","lev2018unforeseen"
