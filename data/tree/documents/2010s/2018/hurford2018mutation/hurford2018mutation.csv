"single mutation","/>","language",NA,"","preadaptation","hypothesis",NA,"""The grammatical system of a language and supporting, or ancillary, systems (storage, working memory, vocal or manual skills, pragmatic skills, among others) all had to evolve in partnership. Pleiotropy (one gene, many traits) is possible, but the traits governed by a pleiotropic gene are seldom so functionally coordinated. Known language-related genes, for example, FOXP2, ... do not do the whole job of accounting for the human language capacity. A single mutation underlying language is not plausible.""","hurford2018mutation"
"natural selection",">","language",NA,"","preadaptation","hypothesis",NA,"""The 'no natural selection’ hypothesis would either predict that humans incapable of Merge (whether privately or publicly) are not pathological cases, not evolutionarily disadvantaged (which is clearly false), or claim that the Merge capacity (whether private or public) went to fixation in humans by a population-level statistical accident (which is extremely unlikely). So the human capacity to merge (either private concepts or public Signs) is promoted by natural selection""","hurford2018mutation"
