"self-domestication",">","teaching","pos","","coevolution","review","yes","We focus specifically on parenting and teaching behaviors as foundations of cultural transmission processes that may have facilitated the exploitation of our cognitive potential and, ultimately, the emergence of modern languages. ... With respect to language, this developmental niche affords rich linguistic interactions that ensure mastery of increasingly more complex decontextualized languages through forms of teaching that build on human mimetic abilities like demonstration (Gärdenfors, 2017) and input enhancement (Shafto and Goodman, 2008) by parents and other caregivers. Thus, our main point is that the impact of self-domestication on language complexity was exerted through a developmental niche that facilitated learning through teaching.","benitez2018emergence"
"self-domestication",">","juvenility","pos","","coevolution","review","yes","While self-domestication per se may have brought about subtle changes in brain structure and function that contributed to language complexity directly (see Benítez-Burraco, 2017, for discussion), we suggest that it is the less aggressive behavior associated with domestication which served as the main prerequisite for the increase in language complexity. The reason is that a greater sociability enhances the intergroup contacts that ultimately require more complex, cognitively demanding linguistic systems to serve the resulting expanded social networks. Yet only in conjunction with another key consequence of domestication, namely, the increase in neotenic features that sustain extended juvenility (see Hare, 2017, for details), can these systems be learned.","benitez2018emergence"

"social complexity",">","exoteric-like languages","pos","","cultural evolution","hypothesis","yes","On the other hand, subsequent increases in social complexity involving larger population size, greater rates of inter-group economic transactions and cross-cultural exchange, increased polity size, greater division of labor, increased hierarchical social organization and, more recently, the invention of writing systems (Turchin et al., 2017), may have shifted the emphasis from esoteric language use as a joint action tool toward language as a means of decontextualized information transmission between unfamiliar individuals in so-called exoteric communities.
