For social bonding, tolerance, empathy, prosociality and cooperation, the authors specify the following genes: Vasopressin receptor (AVPR1Î±), Oxytocin receptor (OXTR), Oestrogen receptor (Er-b), Dopamine receptor (DRD4), Serotonin transporter (5-HTT). For vocal learning, motor-skill learning and motor control, they specify: Forkhead Box Protein P2 (FOXP2), Contactin Associated Protein-Like 2 (CNTNAP2), KIAA0319, Roundabout Guidance Receptor 1 (ROBO1), Roundabout Guidance Receptor 2 (ROBO2)","staes2018genetic"
