A possible explanation for this is that languages with a greater number of speakers tend to also be those with higher proportions of non-native speakers, who may simplify language during learning...Experiment 2... investigat[es] both the effects of the proportion of simplified data in a learner’s linguistic input—the proposed direct influence of adult learning on linguistic complexity—and the absolute number of speakers who provide the input, to allow for population size itself having some influence on the input which may indirectly influence complexity... We found no condition-dependent differences in the complexity of the acquired languages''","atkinsonetal2018"

As such, it fails to support one account by which individual adult learners simplify a language solely by their simplifications being introduced into the linguistic input for subsequent learners.""","atkinsonetal2018"
