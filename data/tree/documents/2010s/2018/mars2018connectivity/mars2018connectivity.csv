"neural pathways",">","voluntary vocal control","","","preadaptation","","","""In the human, functional imaging studies found representations of the laryngeal musculature in the dorsal part of the orofacial motor cortex... Consistent with the suggestion of increased laryngeal control in humans, this area in the human might have more direct connections to the nucleus ambiguus, a laryngeal brainstem nucleus"" p. 23","mars2018connectivity"
"neural pathways",">","vocal learning","","","preadaptation","","","""The neural circuitry related to vocal learning is more straightforward to study comparatively. It would be expected that the areas involved in human vocal control have increased access to higher-order auditory information"" p. 23","mars2018connectivity"
"voluntary vocal control",">","language","","","coevolution","","","""The evolution of vocal communication in humans requires both the ability to voluntarily control one’s vocal apparatus and the capacity for vocal learning."" p. 22","mars2018connectivity"

"neural pathways",">","language","","","preadaptation","","","""Any theory of the evolution of language has to account for the involvement of the ventral pathways both in language and non-language processes.The ventral pathway, although perhaps more conserved than the dorsal pathway, has undoubtedly been recruited to serve specific language-related functions"" p. 22","mars2018connectivity"
