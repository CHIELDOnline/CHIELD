"word learning","/>","compositional structure",NA,"","cultural evolution","review",NA,"""Languages which are passed from person to person via learning and recall (where the aim of the participant is simply to reproduce the language they were trained on to the best of their ability, rather than use it to communicate with another person) tend to become underspecified and eventually highly degenerate: multiple related concepts are expressed by a small number of highly ambiguous words... Learning is the only pressure at play in these experiments, and simpler systems are easier to learn; furthermore, the mistakes learners make tend to increase simplicity (e.g. in reusing a word to convey a set of related meanings, or jettisoning words altogether). The cumulative effect of this simplicity bias in learning is maximally simple languages.""","smith2018cognitive"
"word use","/>","compositional structure",NA,"","cultural evolution","review",NA,"""In contrast, languages which are not passed on to naive individuals, but instead used repeatedly for communication by the same pair of individuals, become well-tuned to their communicative needs, but not necessarily compositionally structured... The need to communicate successfully forces signals to remain distinct, and since the language is never transmitted to new learners there is no countervailing pressure from learning favouring simplicity.""","smith2018cognitive"
"word learning and use",">","compositional structure",NA,"","cultural evolution","review",NA,"""compositional structure emerges when pressures from learning and use are both at play, but not when these pressures operate in isolation""; ""when languages are both learned and used (with the language produced during communication by one pair forming the input to learning by the next pair in a chain of transmission...), languages evolve which encode features of meaning according to compositional rules. Compositional systems constitute a trade-off between the partially competing pressures from learning and communication, in that compositional grammars are relatively simple yet expressive: the regularities they contain can be exploited by learners during acquisition, but they nonetheless allow meaning to be unambiguously encoded and decoded.""","smith2018cognitive"
