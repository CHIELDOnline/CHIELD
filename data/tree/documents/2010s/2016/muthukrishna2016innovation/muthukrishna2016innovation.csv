"brain size","~","population size","pos",NA,"coevolution","hypothesis","","For primarily asocial learners, the theory predicts a weaker (or non-existent) relationship between brain size/cognitive capacity and group size, because group size is only increased by increased carrying capacity through the benefits of adaptive knowledge. In contrast, for taxa with some amount of social learning, the theory predicts a strong relationship between brain size and group size (and other measures of sociality), because group size also provides access to more adaptive knowledge.

Of course, these languages are related and therefore not statistically independent. To control for linguistic relatedness, we use the Indo-European language tree (from [119]) to calculate independent contrasts for the log of number of speakers and degree of optimization using the pic function in the R package ape [120]. We then fit a linear model using these contrasts (leaving out the intercept term).
