"variation: morphology",">","morphological complexity","neg","Morphology","language change","experiment","","We found that mixing input from multiple speakers nullified the simplifications introduced by non-native learners in Experiment 1. While the output of individuals may be simplified, such simplifications tend to be idiosyncratic, and therefore mixing the output of one or more non-native speakers with the output of native speakers yields a system which is itself complex and variable, and which did not lead to the acquisition of a simpler language by our second generation.","evolang11_48"

"contact: population",">","communicative interaction","pos","Morphology","language change","experiment","","after training on a miniature language (which includes irregular forms for native learners but only regular forms for non-native learners), participants interact in pairs, taking turns to de- scribe scenes for each other. Our results show that a speaker who acquires a more complex language than their partner may simplify their output in interaction, in particular by using (inferred) regular forms instead of irregulars","evolang11_48"
