"word labels",">","structural alignment","pos","Cognitive science","preadaptation","review","yes","Language can support, beyond individual word meanings, relational cognition through inviting structural parallels. Learning the semantic and syntactic structure of the language can invite corresponding conceptual patterns","gentner2016language"
"structural alignment",">","analogical comparison","pos","Cognitive science","preadaptation","review","yes","Comparing two things invites a structure-mapping process in which common relational patterns within the two analogs are aligned (structural alignment) and the entities are placed in correspondence according to the relational alignment.","gentner2016language"
"analogical comparison",">","relational concepts","pos","Cognitive science","preadaptation","review","yes","structural alignment tends to heighten the salience of the common relational structure, making it more likely to transfer to other situations","gentner2016language"

"relational concepts",">","spatial cognition","","Cognitive science","preadaptation","experiment","yes","Languages differ in their preferred spatial frame of reference for describing location. Thus, learning words for spatial relations may benefit our spatial thinking.","gentner2016language"
"relational concepts",">","numerical cognition","","Cognitive science","preadaptation","experiment","yes","Pirah√£ lack a concept of number, contrary to Western people. The conclusion is that, contrary to intuition, the concept of number is not a universal innate endowment. Further, the evidence has suggested that the cardinal numbers come to us via language.","gentner2016language"
