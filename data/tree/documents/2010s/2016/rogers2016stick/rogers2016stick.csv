When their personal shape description was perceived to be more informative than their addressee’s description, there was a strong bias to communicate egocentrically. By contrast, when their addressee’s shape description was perceived to be more informative, there was a strong bias to take their addressee’s perspective. When the shape descriptions were perceived to be equally informative, there was a moderate bias to communicate egocentrically. ","Also reported in: Fay N. and Rogers S. (2016).
