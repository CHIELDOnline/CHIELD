"social network: segregation",">","shared language","neg","lexicon;morphology","language change","simulation","","When the network is divided into groups within which agents strongly influence one another but between which influence is weak, small initial differences in behavior between the groups can be amplified into distinct stable dialects, as long as the disparity in influence between and within the groups is large. This is consistent with what was already observed by Dallâ€™Asta et al. (2006). However, we find that multiple dialects also emerge when agents are embedded in space and interact only with their neighbors, even if the degree of influence between interacting agents is uniform.","evolang11_19"
