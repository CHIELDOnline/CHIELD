"259","","bentz2016learning","proportion of adult learners",">","age of language acquisition","pos","","morphology","language change","hypothesis","","","","","","","","A theory currently gaining ground at the interface of historical linguistics, linguistic typology and sociolinguistics maintains that reduction in morphological complexity might be driven by learning pressures, namely imperfect learning by non-native adults (McWhorter, 2002; McWhorter, 2011; Trudgill, 2011; Wray and Grace, 2007). Adults learning a foreign language often lack the breadth of exposure to the target language that a native speaker would have. Thus, they only partially learn the range of inflectional variants of a word, and omit morphological markers in their language production (Papadopoulou et al., 2011; Haznedar, 2006; Gurel, 2000). If non-native speakers represent a considerable part of the overall speaker population, they might drive the language towards morphological simplification.",""
