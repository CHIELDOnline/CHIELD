"group size","<=>","technical skill","","","coevolution","hypothesis","","""A group of ten probably cannot allow a particularly good arrowhead maker to concentrate on arrowhead making; a group of fifty may well be able to do so. Specialization makes it economically possible to expand the range and quality of technology.""","sterelny2016cumulative"
"group size",">","cooperative foraging","","","cultural evolution","hypothesis","","""The size of the community—both the size of the core foraging band, and the other bands with which there is regular, friendly interaction—really matters.""","sterelny2016cumulative"
"technical skill",">","cooperative foraging","","","cultural evolution","hypothesis","","""hominins evolved as cooperative, skilled, tool-using foragers, as a result of positive feedback between ecological cooperation, information sharing, and reproductive cooperation.""","sterelny2016cumulative"
"cooperative foraging",">","protolanguage","","","cultural evolution","hypothesis","","""a minimal protolanguage emerges through linking amplified great ape gestural communication with inner-template-controlled, structured action sequences (evolving through gene-culture coevolution for enhanced technical skills) and with improved theory of mind (evolving under selection for cooperative foraging).""","sterelny2016cumulative"
"protolanguage","^","social interaction","","","cultural evolution","hypothesis","","""Once protolanguage was established, there would be selection pressure for it to become more dependent on voice.""","sterelny2016cumulative"
"cognition",">","memory","","","preadaptation","hypothesis","","""Hominins who can execute complex action sequences from memory, in the absence of their normal physical substrate, have most of the cognitive machinery needed to produce a stimulus-independent mime of that activity: they just need to reframe the social context and point of the action. For they can produce, say, a sequence of hand actions used to ignite fire without actually holding the fire-starting kit they normally use. To turn vacuum practices and demonstrations into a mime, they need a new trigger to initiate the sequence, and a new way of interpreting others’ practice-like performances. They need communicative intentions and a theory of mind.""","sterelny2016cumulative"
"cognition",">","theory of mind","","","preadaptation","hypothesis","","""Stimulus-independent gestural signals are delivered by inner template control of action sequences and communicative goals, plus enhanced theory-of-mind capacities.""","sterelny2016cumulative"
"memory",">>","language","","","language change","hypothesis","","""Language is a complex system of co-adapted elements, involving memory; executive control; theory of mind; capacities to represent the environment in abstract and a modal ways; and fast, accurate, online processing of complex serial inputs.""","sterelny2016cumulative"
