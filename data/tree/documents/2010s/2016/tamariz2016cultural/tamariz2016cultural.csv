"expressivity","^","language","pos","","language change","review","yes","""The headline conclusion so far is that language evolves to maximise expressivity under pressures for communication whilst minimising complexity under pressure to be learnable. Evidence in support of this conclusion comes from experiments, computational and mathematical models and data from a wide range of languages.""","tamariz2016cultural"

"combinatorial structure","~=","linguistic complexity","neg","","language change","review","yes","""At the end of ten generations, the whistle sounds had become easier to reproduce. They had ceased to be independent; many of them shared discrete internal elements, despite the continuous nature of the slide-whistle medium. In other words, they had developed combinatorial structure.""","tamariz2016cultural"
"hierarchical structure","~=","linguistic complexity","neg","","language change","review","yes","""Subsequences came to be reused and recombined across different items in the set, and incipient hierarchical structure emerged towards the end of the chains.""","tamariz2016cultural"
"combinatorial structure","~=","compressibility","pos","","language change","review","yes","""These examples illustrate the evolution of compressibility of the behaviours of the participants over generations. In both studies, the sets of behaviours have lower entropy at the end of the chains than they did at the start.""","tamariz2016cultural"

"group size",">","iconicity","pos","","cultural evolution","review","yes","""In addition, when the experimenters reduced the number of participants in a microsociety, the signals that arose were more difficult to reproduce and their meaning was less transparent for naive observers relative to the ones produced by larger groups of participants. In other words, they changed from being iconic — where the form resembles the meaning — to being symbolic — where form and meaning are related by an arbitrary convention""","tamariz2016cultural"
"regularisation bias","^","language","n-m","","language change","review","yes","""They started their experiment with a language with unpredictable variation in signals. Over generations, this unpredictable variation came to be regularised. Previously, it was thought that regularisation was a result of children's particularly strong bias for regularisation [41], but Smith and Wonnacott's [40••] participants were adults, showing that cultural evolution can act to amplify weak biases over generations. Other studies [42, 43] have shown that the bias for regularisation may be modulated by task domain, suggesting that the pressure to regularise may be particularly strong in language tasks.""","tamariz2016cultural"
"iconicity",">","combinatorial structure","neg","","language change","review","yes","""The structure of the mapping between signals and meanings is influenced by the structure of meanings themselves [51••]. Roberts et al. [52] had dyads of participants (Figure 3) convey meanings that were either easy or hard to represent iconically in a graphical medium (animal silhouettes and shades of green, respectively). The signals that evolved after repeated communicative interactions differed structurally across conditions: many unique, distinct complex signals evolved for the animals, while a combinatorial system that used a smaller set of simpler signals evolved for the shades of green.""","tamariz2016cultural"
