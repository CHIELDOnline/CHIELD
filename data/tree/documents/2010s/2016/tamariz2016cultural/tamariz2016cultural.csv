"transmission bias: simplicity",">","combinatorial structure","pos","transmission","cultural evolution","review","yes","At the end of ten generations, the whistle sounds had become easier to reproduce. They had ceased to be independent; many of them shared discrete internal elements, despite the continuous nature of the slide-whistle medium. In other words, they had developed combinatorial structure.","tamariz2016cultural"
"iterated learning",">","compressibility","pos","transmission","cultural evolution","review","yes","This emergence of compressibility in behaviours has been argued to be a characteristic outcome of iterated learning","tamariz2016cultural"
"transmission bias: simplicity",">","hierarchical structure","pos","transmission","cultural evolution","review","yes","In related work, Cornish et al.’s [32] transmission chain experiment explored the extent to which cultural evolution can explain the origins of systematic structure in sequences of discrete rather than continuous signals. Their participants had to observe and then recall a large number of sequences of flashing lights. Over ten generations, the sequences became increasingly accurately reproduced, and the set of sequences began to show systematic structure (see Figure 4). Subsequences came to be reused and recombined across different items in the set, and incipient hierarchical structure emerged towards the end of the chains.","tamariz2016cultural"
"group size",">","iconicity","neg","transmission","cultural evolution","review","yes","In addition, when the experimenters reduced the number of participants in a microsociety, the signals that arose were more difficult to reproduce and their meaning was less transparent for naive observers relative to the ones produced by larger groups of participants. In other words, they changed from being iconic — where the form resembles the meaning — to being symbolic — where form and meaning are related by an arbitrary convention","tamariz2016cultural"
"compressibility",">","regularity in language","pos","transmission","cultural evolution","hypothesis","no","Another widespread feature of language is that the mapping between signals and meanings tends to be regular. For example, we tend not to have many synonymous words for the same meaning. This can also be seen as reflecting a preference for compressibility because systems with unconditioned variation have higher entropy.","tamariz2016cultural"
"compressibility","<=>","expressivity","neg","transmission","cultural evolution","review","yes","Converging evidence that language does indeed trade off compressibility and expressivity comes from cross-linguistic studies of semantic categories across a wide range of domains [13], including numerals [47], colour [48], spatial [49], and kinship [50] terms.","tamariz2016cultural"
