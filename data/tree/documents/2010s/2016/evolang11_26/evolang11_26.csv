1,,evolang11_26,theory of mind: level 0,>>,emulation,,,cultural transmission,preadaptation,review,,,,,,,,"Emulation (ToM - 0) is when an individual copies the end - state or 'goal' that a conspecific has produced, without theorizing about the conspecific's behaviour in production (Huang & Charman , 2005).",
2,,evolang11_26,theory of mind: level 1,>>,immitation,,,cultural transmission,preadaptation,review,,,,,,,,"Imitation ( ToM - 1 ) is process - oriented , and cop ies a conspecific's behaviour in order to produce a goal (Tomasello , 1996). It requires theorizing a relationship between the intended a ctions and goal. ",
3,,evolang11_26,theory of mind: level 2,>>,teaching,,,cultural transmission,preadaptation,hypothesis,,,,,,,,Teaching ( ToM - 2 ) is the intentional conferring of knowledge to a conspecific. The author argues that it requires theorizing that another is capable of thinking about the teacher's thoughts.,
4,,evolang11_26,theory of mind: level 1,>>,symbolic signals,,,cultural transmission,preadaptation,review,,,,,,,,"ToM makes word reference possible, since it requires a shared knowledge of a linguistic symbol to be anchored to a referent. Identifying ToM - 1 in the archaeological record is theref ore argued to denote the ability for word reference. ",
5,,evolang11_26,theory of mind: level 2,>>,complement structure,,,cultural transmission,preadaptation,review,,,,,,,,"Mental - state verbs (such as 'know', 'think', ' remember'), as well as the complement structure to organize mental - state verbs, is key in ToM - 2 's maturation (de Villers , 2007 ) ; therefore , it is argued that ToM - 2 in the archaeological record denotes the presence of complementation and lexical items to describe mental states.
