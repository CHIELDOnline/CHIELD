"""loners""",">","reintroduction of marginal variants","pos","","language change","simulation","yes","""Loners in our simulations also represent such isolated figures. They do not listen to others, but there are a few members in the community who are in touch with them and can be influenced by them...These loners served as either sources of new variants, or repositories of past norms, and thereby multiple variants could be simultaneously maintained in the population. This allowed the norm to change over time as, probabilistically, a loner’s variant could be picked up by some other agents and propagated through the rest of the population.""","fagyal2010centers"
"highly connected individuals (hubs)",">","diffusion of variants","pos","","language change","simulation","yes","""Our simulations have also demonstrated that centers are propagators and enforcers of norms, but they are not necessarily innovators. They can, but do not have to, be ‘‘introducers’’ of novel variants...whenever hubs were present in the network, they successfully propagated one of the competing variants. Highly-influential centers can, of course, also introduce novel variants, copy innovations from other leaders and their cohorts. Calling them innovators, however, obscures their essential function of spreading, rather than inventing or introducing, the most socially prestigious variants.""","fagyal2010centers"
"preferential adoption of variants from popular individuals",">","stability of norms","pos","","language change","simulation","yes","""In the first case, we revert to a simple version of the voter model... Instead of biasing the choice of a neighbor to imitate by that neighbor’s in-degree (number of times chosen as popular), agents treat all their neighbors equally... The population of agents show no collective sensitivity to individual agents’ social influence, which leads to failure of appearance of norms. The competing variants diffuse in a chaotic way: some are sporadically propagated for a short amount of time by some influential hubs, but since too many equally attractive variants are present in the population, a single variant cannot emerge and become established as a norm for an extended period.""","fagyal2010centers"
"reintroduction of marginal variants",">","emergence of new norms","pos","","language change","simulation","yes","""We first altered the current network structure by making it so dense as to lack isolated individuals... We see that the population converges very quickly to a norm, which then stays fixed: all 900 agents adopt one variant, eliminating all the others completely. In the previous simulation, there were a few loners whose chosen variants never changed and, therefore, only matched the rest of These loners served as either sources of new variants, or repositories of past norms, and thereby multiple variants could be simultaneously maintained in the population. This allowed the norm to change over time as, probabilistically, a loner’s variant could be picked up by some other agents and propagated through the rest of the population. In absence of such very peripheral agents, this clearly cannot happen, as very high density leads to hyper-rapid convergence at the expense of all future network-internal innovations. Thus, as hypothesized, the contribution of peripheral individuals is crucial for the social dynamics underlying the diffusion process.""","fagyal2010centers"
