"population movement",">","language spread","pos",NA,"cultural evolution","review","none","""Work by Bellwood (2002), Renfrew (1987), Nettle (1999), and others (known as the ‘farming dispersal hypothesis’) causally links both Holocene language spread and the distribution of certain linguistic features to the advantages that agriculture brings.""","bowern2010correlates"

"social network density",">","resistance to change","pos",NA,"language change","review","none","""Milroy and Milroy (1992, 5), and earlier Milroy and Milroy (1985) provide evidence that dense and multiplex social networks are conservatizing; change is difficult to introduce to the network, and local norms are closely enforced.""","bowern2010correlates"
"social network density",">","diffusion of innovations","pos",NA,"language change","review","none","""An alternative argument is provided by Nettle (2000a,b, 1999), who maintains that we would expect changes to be implemented more quickly in such groups simply because it takes less time for a change to diffuse across a group of 500 people than one of 50,000.""","bowern2010correlates"
