"resource density",">","recognise in-group","neg","diversity","language change","experiment","","the ideal player would avoid ever giving resources away to their opponents, while always appearing to be the team-mate of whoever they were partnered with for a given round. This meant finding some way of identifying one's team-mate, and the only channel by which this could be achieved was the negotiation stage of the round.","roberts2010experimental"
"recognise in-group",">","linguistic variation: between groups","pos","diversity","language change","experiment","","The results suggested that the pressure to identify oneself to one's team-mate caused the alien language to diverge into team 'dialects'","roberts2010experimental"
