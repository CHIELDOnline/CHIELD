"cooperation","~=","cooperative hunting","none","Social Structure","preadaptation","review","","""at least one skill, tracking, is practiced in living huntergatherers as a sophisticated collective hypothesis testing enterprise in which verbal discussion is essential (see also Liebenberg 1990, Guthrie 2005). Trackers need to have natural-historical knowledge that often outruns that of the modern naturalists who have interacted with them (Blurton-Jones & Konner 1976) and would no doubt be hard to transmit without language.""","richerson2010possibly"
"acquisition bias: prestige",">","cultural variability: within-group","neg","Social Structure","cultural evolution","review","","""Culture evolves more rapidly than genes because culture is modified by learned innovations not just random mutation and because we can actively choose superior variants either by direct experimentation with variants or by rules of thumb like imitating the successful or prestigious.""

"cultural variability: across-group",">","trust: across-group","neg","Social Structure","cultural evolution","review","","""Because language can evolve differences so rapidly, it can evolve to calibrate our discrimination against outsiders quite sensitively. I may perfectly well understand someone whose dialect differs only modestly from mine, but I may still distrust them."" (298)","richerson2010possibly"
"migration",">","cultural variability: across-group","neg","Social Structure","cultural evolution","review","","""Boyd & Richerson (1987) studied a cultural evolutionary model in which two populations lived in different environments [...] Individuals migrated between the two populations, tending to homogenize them at some intermediate value of the adaptive character not well adapted to either environment.""
