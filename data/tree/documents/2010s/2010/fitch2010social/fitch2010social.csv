"social intelligence",">","general intelligence","pos","cognition","coevolution","hypothesis","no","""The “social intelligence hypothesis” is a leading contemporary hypothesis that attempts to explain the evolution of intelligence, in general, as a result of selection for social intelligence in particular ""","fitch2010social"
"tool use",">","general intelligence","pos","cognition","coevolution","hypothesis","no","""This hypothesis contrasts with the older “physical intelligence hypothesis” that supposes that intelligence, particularly human intelligence, is the result of intense selection for the use of tools and other manipulations of the environment.""","fitch2010social"

"theory of mind",">","language acquisition","pos","language acquisition","coevolution","review","yes","""TOM is a core human capacity, underlying many pragmatic aspects of adult language use and closely tied to child language acquisition""","fitch2010social"
"imitation",">","cumulative culture","pos","cultural evolution","cultural evolution","review","yes",""" At the heart of culture is a means of high-accuracy copying, which provides the analog of genetic transmission. Human cultural evolution also allows for accumulation of good ideas, a fact that is central to human cultural progress""","fitch2010social"
"social living",">","social learning","pos","cultural evolution","cultural evolution","hypothesis","no","""An often implicit assumption is that living in social groups favors the evolution of social learning, leading to the idea that social learning is an adaptation for social living.""","fitch2010social"
"social learning",">","social intelligence","pos","cognition","coevolution","review","yes","""Social learning is a core element of the social intelligence hypothesis (Dunbar and Shultz, 2007; Humphrey, 1976), which suggests that the physical environment does not present the kind of challenges that lead to the evolution of a flexible, intelligent mind, but that the social environment does. ""","fitch2010social"
"scavenging",">","displacement","pos","early language evolution","preadaptation","review","no","""singled out one design feature of human language (Hockett, 1960) as both crucial and very rare: the capacity for displacement. Human language, unlike most animal signals, can convey information about objects or events that are not present. Bickerton proposes that the driving force behind this feature during hominid evolution was the need for cooperative scavenging of large carcasses, which would be too large to be moved, but so rich as to constitute a windfall for any primate group able to defend and butcher them.""","fitch2010social"

""","fitch2010social"
"mirror neurons",">","gestures","pos","early language evolution","preadaptation","hypothesis","no","""the discovery of mirror neurons was seen by some as support for the gestural protolanguage hypothesis: the idea that hominids evolved language in the gestural domain before the evolution of spoken language""","fitch2010social"
