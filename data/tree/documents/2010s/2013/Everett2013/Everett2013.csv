"elevation",">","ejective sounds","pos","","language change","statistical","none","""Languages with phonemic ejective consonants were found to occur closer to inhabitable regions of high elevation, when contrasted to languages without this class of sounds. (...) We suggest that ejective sounds might be facilitated at higher elevations due to the associated decrease in ambient air pressure, which reduces the physiological effort required for the compression of air in the pharyngeal cavityâ€“a unique articulatory component of ejective sounds.""","Everett2013"
