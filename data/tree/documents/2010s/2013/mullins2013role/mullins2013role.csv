"reciprocity",">","cooperation","pos","","none","","none","Repeated interactions between the same individuals have been shown to favour a strategy of reciprocity or 'tit-for-tat' cooperation (Axelrod, 1984). (p. S142)","mullins2013role"
"population size",">","reciprocity","neg","","none","","none","Reciprocity poses several unique computational problems for humans in large groups. First, reciprocal acts in large groups are more numerous and heterogeneous, requiring the tracking of thousands of interactions involving diverse goods and services (Trivers, 1971). Second, when compared to other species, highly social and long-lived species such as our own must track interactions over much longer time scales (Melis and Semmann, 2010), which poses additional computational problems when the number of transactions is increased. Third, interactants in large groups must be able to identify and store data pertaining to each exchange, each of which requires the computation of many distinct cost/benefit ratios and complex forms of reciprocity (Boyd and Richerson, 2006). These cost/benefit ratios must be constantly adjusted over time to reflect the increased cost of performing a costly act without receiving a benefit in return (Trivers, 1971). Finally, all of this additional transactional data must be stored and readily recalled at a high-fidelity to serve as a guide for future behaviour. (p. S144)","mullins2013role"

"reputation",">","cooperation","pos","","none","","none","Reputation management thus became crucially important to an individualâ€™s reproductive fitness, producing among other things a hypersensitivity to being observed by others (Bateson et al., 2006). Human reputational concerns promote cooperation by providing new information about potential partners and by changing incentives to defect by attaching a reputation benefit to cooperation and a reputation cost to defection.

"population size",">","respect for norms","neg","","none","","none","Ambiguity about the mutual adherence to social norms increases in large group living for two reasons. First, interactants in large groups are less sure about what the norm actually is and whether they will be punished for not adhering to the social norm. Second, interactants are less sure that others are following a perceived social norm or that others will be punished if they do not follow a perceived social norm. (p. S146)","mullins2013role"

(p. S146) Second, writing and recordkeeping systems facilitate the transmission of social norms and associated moral punishments by providing a portable (Goody, 1977; Daniels, 1996; Coulmas, 1999), high-fidelity (Goody, 1977; Changizi, 2009), permanent (Goody and Watt, 1963) and repeatedly accessible mechanism (Goody, 1977; Clark, 1998) for their dissemination.

"writing",">","empathy","pos","","none","","none","Recent psychological and historical evidence suggests increases in literacy rates and the production of literature are tied to increases in empathy. In his discussion of the precipitous decline of violence in seventeenth and eighteenth-century England, Pinker (2011) suggests that increases in the production (e.g. the introduction and development of the printing press) and consumption (e.g. increased literacy rates, more accessible literature) of forms of literature (e.g. journalism, memoir, fiction, history) prompted readers to adopt the perspective of the individuals discussed in print. This projection or increased perspective-taking, in turn, induced a state of sympathy, which increased the probability that in individual in a reading public would conduct altruistic behaviours on behalf of the individual or group described in the literature. This prediction is supported by historical data sets of efficiency in book production (Clark, 2007), numbers of books published (Simons, 2001), and literacy rates (Clark, 2007), which correlate with a decline in violence in seventeenth and eighteenth-century England. Additionally, the capacity for literacy to induce empathy is supported by experimental evidence using two versions of the Prisoner's Dilemma game. The first, a one-shot Prisoner's Dilemma, found that the rate of coop- erating jumped from 20 to 70% when participants read a personal note from an interactant (Batson and Moran, 1999). The second, an iterated Prisoner's Dilemma, found that only 5% percent of the interactants cooperated in response to a defection, while interactants who had read a personal note from another interactant beforehand cooperated 45% of the time (Batson and Ahmad, 2001).
