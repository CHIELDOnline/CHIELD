Given the latitudinal patterns present, it is surprising that previous studies have indicated that both individual environmental variables, such as net primary productivity, and suites of environmental factors explain (in the statistical sense) only a small percentage of the variance in linguistic diversity (e.g., less than 20%; Moore et al. 2002, Currie and Mace 2009).
