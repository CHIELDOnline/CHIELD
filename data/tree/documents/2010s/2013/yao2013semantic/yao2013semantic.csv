"lexicon: semantic size",">","lexical decision","neg","","language change","experiment","","We hypothesized that responses would be faster to words denoting bigger objects/concepts (e.g., elephant, paradise) than to words denoting smaller objects/concepts (e.g., ornament, intimate) ... This was supported by the observed processing advantage for bigger (concrete) words [6] as well as by a diverse literature which substantiates a �bigger is better� perspective (see, e.g., [19]�[22]). ... The moderated mediation analyses indicated that semantic size of words directly influences lexical access speed in both Concrete and Abstract words.","yao2013semantic"

That is, there should be a stronger link between semantic size and emotionality for abstract rather than concrete words. ...

"arousal",">","semantic representation","","","language change","statistical","","(see Figure 2D) Overall, the results showed that, for abstract words, Size and Arousal influenced word recognition latencies interactively. Specifically, the Size effect was salient at lower levels of arousal, but was masked at higher levels (Figure 1, right panel). Critically, Size and Arousal appeared to act competitively. Such a result pattern favors our first hypothesis (see H1) to account for the correlation between Size and Arousal which suggests that Size and Arousal share a common representational nature.
