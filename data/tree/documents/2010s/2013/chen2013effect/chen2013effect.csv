"obligatory grammatical distinction: future time reference",">","beliefs: time: event delay","pos",NA,"language change","model","yes","The first way that language may affect future choices is by changing how distant future eventsfeel. For example, it seems plausible that speaking about future events as if they were happening now (in the present tense), would lead weak-FTR speakers to perceive future events as less distant.","chen2013effect"
"obligatory grammatical distinction: future time reference",">","beliefs: time: event precision","pos",NA,"language change","model","yes","The second way that language may affect future choices is by leading speakers to have more or less precise beliefs about the timing of future rewards. Languages with more grammatical time marking would lead speakers to hold more precise beliefs about the timing of events if either: marking time requires increased attention to time, or if these markers are encoded in memory. ... if more finely partitioning events in time leads to more precise beliefs, weak-FTR speakers will be more willing to save than their strong-FTR counterparts. Intuitively, since discounting implies that the value of future rewards is a strictly-convex function of time, uncertainty about the timing of future payoffs makes saving more attractive.
