"lexicon: arousal","~","lexicon: valence","n-m","","language change","experiment","","We found the typical U-shaped relationship between arousal and valence (see Fig.-3a; Bradley & Lang, 1999; Redondo, Fraga, Padrón, & Comesaña, 2007; Soares, Comesaña, Pinheiro, Simões, & Frade, 2012): Words that are very positive or very negative are more arousing than those that are neutral.","warriner2013norms"

"lexicon: valence","~","lexicon: dominance","pos","","language change","experiment","","The relationship between valence and dominance is linear, with words that make people feel happier also making them feel more in control (see Fig.-3c). - The strength of the correlation between dominance and valence casts doubt on the claim that the three dimensions under consideration here are genuinely orthogonal affective states.
