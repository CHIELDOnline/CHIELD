"language structure: economy",">","nominal case complexity","","","language change","review","","Languages which adhere to the trade-off hypothesis use only one coding device (either case marking or rigid word order), or they have less variety in the marking patterns of one coding device compared to that of the other coding device. Using a single coding device instead of two, or mutually limiting the variety of marking patterns of the coding devices, is a manifestation of the Zipfian principle of least effort or economy (e.g., Hawkins 2004; Hornstein et al. 2005; Haspelmath 2008).","sinnemaki2014complexity"
