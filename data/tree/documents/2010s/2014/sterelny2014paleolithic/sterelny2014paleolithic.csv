These brought both the possibilities of trade and exogamy, but also even more serious possibilities of conflict. For many reasons, then, reciprocation management became central to social life.","sterelny2014paleolithic"
"delayed return reciprocation based cooperation",">","conflict",NA,"Demography","coevolution","hypothesis",NA,"Those economic changes changed the basis of cooperation from mutualism to reciprocation, a change that made monitoring of the costs and benefits of cooperation much more difficult, and thus much increased the risks of conflict.","sterelny2014paleolithic"
"conflict","^","conflict resolution",NA,"Demography","coevolution","logical",NA,"Reciprocation-based cooperation is more cognitively and motivationally demanding than mutualism, and is more apt to generate conflict. So as the economic organization of forager lives changed, they evolved a set of social tools for limiting conflict costs: (1) an elaborated kinship system; (2) explicit norms; (3) rituals, ceremonies, myths.","sterelny2014paleolithic"

But if ethnography is any guide, there is an intimate link between the material symbols of a group, and their norms and rituals. The hypothesis is then that preserving the social peace as economic and demographic complexity increases is norm and ritual hungry, hence it is symbol hungry too. ","sterelny2014paleolithic"
