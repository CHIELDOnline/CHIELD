Specifically, the underlying functional form of this relation between valence ratings and log-transformed RTs was strictly linear in the regression analyses we ran; using a curvilinear form for valence failed to improve the fit of the model to the data.

"lexicon: valence",">","attention","neg","","language change","experiment","","Because negative stimuli in general require faster responses, they tend to be detected more rapidly. ... However, the automatic vigilance hypothesis was developed to account for the observation that these same words in other tasks elicit slower responding (see also Pratto & John, 1991; Williams et al., 1996). A simple solution is that negative stimuli hold attention longer than other stimuli (Fox et al., 2001), and this sustained attention to negativity delays responding on other tasks such as color naming. After all, if the adaptive significance of automatic vigilance is to facilitate avoidance of dangerous stimuli, then negativity should speed rather than slow responding.","kuperman2014emotion"

"lexicon: frequency of use",">","attention","neg","","language change","experiment","","Valence and arousal do not interact, but both interact with word frequency, such that valence and arousal exert larger effects among low-frequency words than among high-frequency words.  ... it is simply possible that nonwords in general are perceived as slightly negative because they are unfamiliar: Warriner et al. (2013) show that lower-frequency words tend to be rated with lower valence. If this is the case, the valence of the stimulus will provide information about its �wordness� and will speed up the acceptance of positive words (e.g., Keuleers & Brysbaert, 2011). Thus, the automatic vigilance hypothesis � that negative stimuli engage attention longer than other stimuli � can be translated into �require more word-specific activation� or a �higher level of activation� to exceed the response threshold in a lexical decision task.","kuperman2014emotion"
