"musilanguage",">","music","","","cultural evolution","hypothesis","","'musilanguage' a.k.a. 'communicative musicality'. Lawson writes ""musilanguage, as the precursor to music and language, is a biologically deeply rooted human capacity, evidenced by its continued presence in the well-documented interaction between human mothers and their pre-linguistic infants"" (p.8); ""maternal-infant interaction not only represents the foundation for music but for all human communication"" (p.5)","lawson2014music"

According to Lawson, a ""modern Chinese form of musilanguage"" (p.8); a music/language hybrid that demonstrates ""the tenacity of lexical tone and its musical play in the language-music relationships of a modern genre"" (p.13)","lawson2014music"

"notation systems","<=>","shuochang","","","","","","Lawson discusses how Chinese shuochang has been ""technologised through visual orthographies"" (p.8), i.e. influenced by its notation. See pp.17-24 for her case study.","lawson2014music"
"language: tonal",">","language: non-tonal","","","language change","hypothesis","","supports Brown's hypothesis that ""language evolved as a tonal system from its inception, and that the evolutionary emergence of nontonal languages (intonation languages) occurred due to loss of lexical tone. In other words, this hypothesis states that tonality is the ancestral state of language"" (Brown, quoted on p.12)","lawson2014music"
