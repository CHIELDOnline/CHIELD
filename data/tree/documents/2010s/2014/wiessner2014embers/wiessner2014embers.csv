"fire control",">","cooking","","","preadaptation","hypothesis","","""Control of fire had an enormous impact on the life of our hominin ancestors. As Wrangham and Carmody have so cogently argued, the use of fire for cooking greatly increased the digestibility of food and effective provisioning of young, allowing for shorter birth intervals... Fire altered anatomy, particularly brain size and gut volume, and radically reduced chewing time... Current archaeological evidence indicates that our ancestors had sporadic control of fire by 1 million y ago or longer... and regular use after approximately 400,000 ka"" (p. 14027)","wiessner2014embers"

"extended day",">","sociality: nighttime","","","cultural evolution","hypothesis","","""firelight extended the day, creating effective time for social activities that did not conflict with productive time for subsistence activities. Comparison of 174 day and nighttime conversations among the Ju/’hoan (!Kung) Bushmen of southern Africa, supplemented by 68 translated texts, suggests that day talk centers on economic matters and gossip to regulate social relations. Night activities steer away from tensions of the day to singing, dancing, religious ceremonies, and enthralling stories, often about known people. Such stories describe the workings of entire institutions in a small-scale society with little formal teaching. Night talk plays an important role in evoking higher orders of theory of mind via the imagination, conveying attributes of people in broad networks (virtual communities), and transmitting the “big picture” of cultural institutions that generate regularity of behavior, cooperation, and trust at the regional level"" (p. 14027); ""Agendas of the day are dropped while small children fall asleep in the laps of kin. Whereas time structures interactions by day because of economic exigencies, by night social interactions structure time and often continue until relationships are right. Foragers make use of daytime efficiently and nighttime effectively"" (p. 14027)","wiessner2014embers"
