[...] Words [...] can be learned rapidly (indeed, during the vocabulary spurt, children may learn as many as 10 words each day), and require few exposures."" The point is that new words are easy to learn, so more likely to diffuse, and so total vocabulary size increases the more innovations can diffuse.","reali2014paradox"

Hence, large communities will end up with large inventories of easy features. By contrast, Hard properties of the language require many exposures to learn, so that propagating such properties across the population is more difficult.""","reali2014paradox"
