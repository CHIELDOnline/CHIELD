"bilingualism",">","executive control","pos","Bilingualism","coevolution","experiment","yes","the executive control system for language processing in response to the problem created by jointly activated languages strengthens that system more broadly so that performance on nonverbal problems that involve conflict is also enhanced. ","bialystok2014language"
"bilingualism",">","cognitive reserve","pos","Bilingualism","coevolution","experiment","yes","benefits of bilingualism have been found through the lifespan including in older age, modulating the natural decline of cognitive function with healthy aging. This general notion of protection against cognitive decline is called “cognitive reserve” ","bialystok2014language"
"bilingualism",">","lexical access","neg","Bilingualism","coevolution","experiment","yes","Differences in lexical access as a function of language background are well documented: bilinguals typically take significantly longer to retrieve individual words than do monolinguals.","bialystok2014language"
"bilingualism",">","plasticity","pos","Bilingualism","coevolution","experiment","yes","bilingualism modifies cognitive networks and enhances executive control functioning. Therefore, bilingual individuals do not have minds and brains that are identical to their monolingual counterparts. ","bialystok2014language"
"bilingualism",">","verbal processing","neg","Bilingualism","coevolution","experiment","yes"," bilinguals generally perform more poorly than monolinguals on verbal fluency tests. These are standardized tests that are used as neuropsychological measures of brain functioning and are routinely administered to evaluate the impact of brain injury, cognitive decline, and dementia.

"cognitive reserve",">","cognitive functioning","pos","Bilingualism","coevolution","experiment","yes"," impact of enhancing specific cognitive networks reverberates throughout multiple cognitive networks, modifying performance broadly. Thus, intense experience that employs specific processes as part of routine functioning (eg., bilingualism) has the capacity to make fundamental changes in the structure and function of mind.","bialystok2014language"
