Boro-Garo language Boro is morphologically analytic, more so than what proto-Tibeto-Burman was. Kuki-Chin language Lai, however, has developed new morphological markers on the verb, which do not exist in Boro-Garo languages but also not in proto-Tibeto-Burman. Socio-historically Boro-Garo languages are “valley-languages” which are relatively large and have been under heavy language, while Kuki-Chin languages are “hill-languages”, spoken by smaller communities in more isolated locations.","delancey_2014"
