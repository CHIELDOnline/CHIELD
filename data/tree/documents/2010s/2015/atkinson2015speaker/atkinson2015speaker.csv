"population size",">","heterogeneity of speech community","pos","","","review",""," One source of the latter kind of variability is the differences in the idiosyncratic pronunciations of the speakers who provide the input. This results from dia- lectal differences and variable speech rates, as well as anatomical differences amongst the speakers, such as the length and shapes of their oral and nasal cavities","","atkinson2015speaker"
"population size",">","number of speaker models","pos","","","review",""," Speaker input variability may therefore be increased either by the pronunciation being less homogeneous across the speakers, or by the data being provided by a greater number of speakers","","atkinson2015speaker"
