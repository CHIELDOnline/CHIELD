"4","population size",">","heterogeneity of speech community","pos",NA,NA,"review",""," One source of the latter kind of variability is the differences in the idiosyncratic pronunciations of the speakers who provide the input. This results from dialectal differences and variable speech rates, as well as anatomical differences amongst the speakers, such as the length and shapes of their oral and nasal cavities","atkinson2015speaker"
"5","population size",">","number of speaker models","pos",NA,NA,"review",""," Speaker input variability may therefore be increased either by the pronunciation being less homogeneous across the speakers, or by the data being provided by a greater number of speakers","atkinson2015speaker"
