"tool making","<=>","language","none","","coevolution","hypothesis","","Furthermore, due to the challenging ecological niche that early hominins occupied20,32 and the difficulty of acquiring tool-making skills6, fitness benefits were likely associated with the ability to make and deploy effective cutting tools32 as well as the ability to rapidly transmit the skills33, and so a co-evolutionary relationship between tool making and cognition, specifically teaching and language, would seem plausible.","morgan2015experimental"

"tool use","<=>","social transmission","none","","coevolution","logical","","In sum, our data support the hypothesis that a gene-culture co-evolutionary dynamic between tool use and social transmission was on-going in human evolution, starting at least 2.5 mya and potentially continuing to the present.","morgan2015experimental"
