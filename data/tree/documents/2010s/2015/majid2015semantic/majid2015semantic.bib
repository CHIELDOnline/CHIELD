  abstract = {In each semantic domain studied to date, there is considerable variation in how meanings are expressed across languages. But are some
semantic domains more likely to show variation than others? Is the domain of space more or less variable in its expression than other
semantic domains, such as containers, body parts, or colours? According to many linguists, the meanings expressed in grammaticised
expressions, such as (spatial) adpositions, are more likely to be similar across languages than meanings expressed in open class lexical
items. On the other hand, some psychologists predict there ought to be more variation across languages in the meanings of adpositions,
than in the meanings of nouns. This is because relational categories, such as those expressed as adpositions, are said to be constructed by
language; whereas object categories expressed as nouns are predicted to be “given by the world”. We tested these hypotheses by
comparing the semantic systems of closely related languages. Previous cross-linguistic studies emphasise the importance of studying
diverse languages, but we argue that a focus on closely related languages is advantageous because domains can be compared in a
culturally- and historically-informed manner. Thus we collected data from 12 Germanic languages. Naming data were collected from at
least 20 speakers of each language for containers, body-parts, colours, and spatial relations. We found the semantic domains of colour and
body-parts were the most similar across languages. Containers showed some variation, but spatial relations expressed in adpositions
showed the most variation. The results are inconsistent with the view expressed by most linguists. Instead, we find meanings expressed
in grammaticised meanings are more variable than meanings in open class lexical items.},
