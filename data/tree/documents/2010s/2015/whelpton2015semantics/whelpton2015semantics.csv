Objects, particularly those with boundaries and functions readily discernible from other aspects of our surroundings, could be thought of as exemplifying such external structural categories. ...We argue in favour of a hypothesis by Malt and her colleagues (Malt et al., 2003, p. 35; Malt and Majid, 2013, p. 588) that the morphology of a language can have an influence on the placement of extensional boundaries within a lexical domain. Specifically, we argue that the diminutive suffix �(t)je in Dutch encourages a separation of small from other objects in the lexicalisation of the container domain. This is not observed in Icelandic, where the break is more typically between small and medium objects on the one hand and large ones on the other. ","whelpton2015semantics"
"sensorimotor perception",">","semantic categories: size","","categorical perception","language change","statistical","no","Others have claimed that this apparent structure is in fact made by our own senses, and that our minds are innately endowed with instinctive frames of reference that organise the input of our senses in characteristic ways (Fodor, 1975). As Chomsky puts it: �But no one can seriously doubt that for all organisms, what counts as experience is richly determined by internal factors, which construct an organism-specific Umwelt� (Chomsky, 2003, p. 301).  ..We argue in favour of a hypothesis by Malt and her colleagues (Malt et al., 2003, p. 35; Malt and Majid, 2013, p. 588) that the morphology of a language can have an influence on the placement of extensional boundaries within a lexical domain.

Rather it is the systematic pattern of our own language, its vocabulary and grammatical organisation, which imposes a structure upon our perceptions where no such structure exists (Sapir, 1929, Sapir, 1912, Whorf, 1956). ...We argue in favour of a hypothesis by Malt and her colleagues (Malt et al., 2003, p. 35; Malt and Majid, 2013, p. 588) that the morphology of a language can have an influence on the placement of extensional boundaries within a lexical domain.
