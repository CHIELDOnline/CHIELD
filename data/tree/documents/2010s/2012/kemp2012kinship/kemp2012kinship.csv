"cognitive cost",">","kinship terminology: complexity","neg","","language change","logical","none","""Intuitively, a kin classification system is complex if it includes many terms that must be learned and remembered and if each of those terms has a complex definition. We formalize this idea by assuming that kin classification systems arementally encoded in a representation language and that the complexity of a system corresponds to the length of its shortest description in this language."" p 1050","kemp2012kinship"

Figure 5D shows that for each subtree, conjunctive categories have smaller (i.e., better) ranks on average than disjunctive categories. Although our theory tends to penalize disjunctive systems, fig. S9 (25) shows that the near-optimality results in Fig. 4 are driven by more than just this fact"" p. 1053","kemp2012kinship"
