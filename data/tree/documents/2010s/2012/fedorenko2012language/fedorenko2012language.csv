"broca's area: BA45","~","human language","pos","neurobiology","preadaptation","experiment","yes","We found two distinct subregions, each present in at least 90% of subjects individually, with strikingly different but highly reliable functional profiles, lying side by side within Brocaâ€™s area and each spanning the BA44/45 boundary (Figure 1). One subregion, identified in each subject as responding more during the processing of sentences than nonwords, showed little response to any other task, with the BA45 portion being particularly selective","fedorenko2012language"
