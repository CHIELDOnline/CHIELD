"age of acquisition",">","lexicon: frequency of use","neg",NA,"language change","experiment",NA,"Two reasons have been proposed for the importance of AoA in word recognition. The first is that word frequency measures as currently collected do not fully match the cumulative frequency with which participants have been exposed to words (Bonin, Barry, M�ot, & Chalard, 2004; Zevin & Seidenberg, 2002; but see P�rez, 2007).  ... AoA correlated strongly with word frequency, and the relationship was log-linear (see below). ","kuperman2012age"
"age of acquisition",">","lexical decision","pos",NA,"language change","experiment",NA,"the order in which words are learned influences the speed with which their representations can be activated, independently of the total number of times that they have been encountered. � we confirmed that AoA is an important variable to control in word recognition experiments. In the various analyses that we ran, AoA always had a high correlation with the dependent variable (in particular, with lexical-decision time), and it explained 2 %�10 % of variance.  ... Surprisingly, the relationship of the mean AoA ratings with lexical-decision times was completely linear, with an estimated 27-ms increase in response time per increase by 1 year of AoA (see Fig. 4).","kuperman2012age"

"education","/>","age of acquisition","",NA,"language change","experiment",NA,"The numeric AoA ratings did not vary by the education levels of the responders � This null effect in subjective judgments of AoA is surprising, given the wealth of developmental literature showing that early advantages in vocabulary size (e.g., larger numbers of word types learned earlier) are excellent predictors of future educational achievements (e.g., Biemiller & Slonim, 2001).","kuperman2012age"

On average, older participants gave higher AoA ratings than did younger participants, presumably because they had a broader age range to choose from.","kuperman2012age"
