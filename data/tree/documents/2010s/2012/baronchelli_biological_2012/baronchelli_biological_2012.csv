"bias: flexible learning",">","language diversity","pos",NA,"language change","simulation",NA,"Thus, rather than genetic adaptations for specific aspects of language, such as recursion, the coevolution of genes and fast-changing linguistic structure provides the biological basis for linguistic diversity. Only biological adaptations for flexible learning combined with cultural evolution can explain how each child has the potential to learn any human language.","baronchelli_biological_2012"
"divergent cultural evolution",">","bias: flexible learning","pos",NA,"language change","simulation",NA,"flexible learners can best cope with the observed high rates of linguistic change associated with divergent cultural evolution following human migration ... Our results indicate that humans have evolved a biological adaptation specifically for keeping up with the rapid cultural evolution of language, instead of a special-purpose linguistic system analogous to the visual system","baronchelli_biological_2012"
