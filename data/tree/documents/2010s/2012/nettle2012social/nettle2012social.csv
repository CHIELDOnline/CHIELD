"14","population size","~","number of speaker models","pos","","cultural evolution","hypothesis","none","in small communities, each learner acquires language from a smaller set of individuals than they would in a larger community [32]. There is no direct evidence for this proposition, but it may be plausible, given that small languages are generally spoken in isolated subsistence communities with low levels of political organization and economic development.","nettle2012social"
"15","population size","~","social network clusteredness","neg","","cultural evolution","hypothesis","","individuals in small communities acquire language from the same number of models as in large communities, but their social networks are more clus- tered. That is, if individual A is exposed to the speech of individuals B and C, then there is a high degree of expected overlap in the speech sample to which B and C were exposed as they learned.","nettle2012social"

"19","l2 attainment: morphosyntax",">","morphological complexity: paradigmatic","neg","","","hypothesis","","It could be that when the input to language learning is very heterogeneous, these fine distinctions are more likely to fail to be acquired, with the learner not able to discriminate the pattern among the noise. The learner would then develop a grammar lacking the morphological means to make a semantically important distinction, and would spontaneously innovate with a lexical strategy such as adding a word for ""two"" or 'yesterday' to fulfil the appropriate communicative function.","nettle2012social"

"30","L1 learnability",">","morphological complexity: paradigmatic","pos","","","hypothesis","","An alternative possibility is that much morphology is not directly communicatively advantageous, but rather enhances the learnability of language by children","nettle2012social"
"31","L1 communicative efficiency",">","morphological complexity: paradigmatic","pos","","","hypothesis","","One possibility is that paradigmatic morphology increases the overall rate of information transmission, as suggested in fig.2b. This would mean that using more morphological strategies allows speakers to communicate efficiently and concisely, and will thus tend to be incrementally favoured in speech wherever the simplifying consequences of adult language acquisition are not in force.","nettle2012social"
"32","fixation of non-optimal solutions",">","phonological complexity: paradigmatic","n-m","","","hypothesis","no","Trudgill's argument is slightly different but makes a similar prediction of disfavoured structures being more likely to persist in small communities. Assuming that intermediate sizes of phonological inventory, and intermediate levels of morphological complexity, represent the communicatively optimal language system, this predicts that languages spoken in small communities should be more extreme than those spoken in large ones. That is, a small language should be more likely to have a very large or very small phonological inventory, a very low or very high level of morphological complexity, with languages of large communities more likely to be in the middle","nettle2012social"
"33","faster rates of change",">","fixation of non-optimal solutions","pos","","","hypothesis","","Nettle argued that the turnover of linguistic change would be faster in small communities, and, relatedly, that communicatively suboptimal grammatical strategies were more likely to drift to fixation in small communities than in larger ones. ","nettle2012social"
"34","L1 communicative efficiency",">","morphological complexity: syntagmatic","neg","","","hypothesis","","Here, successive generations reinterpret previously separate content words as grammatical modifications of other words, often contracting them in the process. Thus, paradigmatic complexity is gained and syntagmatic complexity is lost.","nettle2012social"
