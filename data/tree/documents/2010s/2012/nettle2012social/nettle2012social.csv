That is, if individual A is exposed to the speech of individuals B and C, then there is a high degree of expected overlap in the speech sample to which B and C were exposed as they learned.

"failure to learn morphology",">","loss of morphological complexity","pos","","","hypothesis","","It could be that when the input to language learning is very heterogeneous, these ﬁne distinctions are more likely to fail to be acquired, with the learner not able to discriminate the pattern among the noise. The learner would then develop a grammar lacking the morphological means to make a semantically important distinction, and would spontaneously innovate with a lexical strategy such as adding a word for ‘two’ or ‘yesterday’ to fulﬁl the appropriate communicative function.","","nettle2012social"
