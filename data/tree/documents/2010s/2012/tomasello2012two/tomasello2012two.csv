"small scale collaboration",">","collaborative foraging","","Cooperation","cultural evolution","hypothesis","","A better model for real-life cooperation is the Stag Hunt (Skyrms 2004). Stag Hunt situations are those in which (i) individuals must collaborate with others to benefit, (ii) the benefits of the collaboration are greater than those of any solo alternatives, and (iii) all solo alternatives must be forsaken (risked) in order to collaborate.","tomasello2012two"

"reproductive bonds",">","small scale collaboration","","Cooperation","cultural evolution","hypothesis","","important role of kinship, as humans evolved more stable reproductive bonds (resulting in an increase in male tolerance), which obviously played an important role in the attitudes of individuals toward one another in small groups","tomasello2012two"

"big prey",">","collaborative partners","","Cooperation","cultural evolution","hypothesis","none","Different cultural groups may do this differently, and it may work differently with particular resources","tomasello2012two"
"coordination strategies","~","sharing spoils","","Cooperation","cultural evolution","hypothesis","","individuals had to find some way to divide the spoils at the end of the collaboration such that there was no destructive fighting and such that everyone was incentivized for future stag hunting.","tomasello2012two"
"group decisions",">","mindreading","","Mindreading","cultural evolution","hypothesis","","To form a joint goal, we must know together that each of us has the goal of working with the other. Knowing together means engaging in some form of recursive mind reading (we each know that the other knows, etc.), which is the basic cognitive ability that enables humans to engage in all forms of joint and collective intentionality","tomasello2012two"
"mindreading",">","shared goals","","Mindreading","cultural evolution","hypothesis","none","Humans coordinate and communicate about their decision making in such situations to form a joint goal.","tomasello2012two"
"shared goals",">","defined roles","","Cooperation","cultural evolution","hypothesis","","defined roles in collaborative activities to achieve shared goals","tomasello2012two"

"group mindedness",">","competition between groups","","Cooperation","cultural evolution","hypothesis",""," probably began playing a role with the emergence of behaviorally modern humans. ","tomasello2012two"
"cultural practices",">","conventions","","Cultural Evolution","cultural evolution","hypothesis","","Cultural practices are different from behavioral traditions because their practitioners understand them as “shared” in the group; that is, they understand them as conventional","tomasello2012two"
"conventions",">","conformity","","Cultural Evolution","cultural evolution","hypothesis","","Conventions generate the conformity characteristic of cultural practices because it is in the individual’s interest to do things the way that others do them so that they can effectively coordinate—and this is especially important if one wishes to be able to coordinate with anyone in the larger society, including strangers.","tomasello2012two"
"conformity",">","coordination","","Cultural Evolution","cultural evolution","hypothesis","","Social norms have force over human behavior because, individuals know that to participate effectively in the collaborative activities of the group, they must conform to the group’s ways of doing things","tomasello2012two"
"conventions",">","recursive mindreading","","Cultural Evolution","cultural evolution","hypothesis","","Conventions thus require some kind of recursive mindreading or common ground as the basis of the agreement, and this basic ability evolved initially, as argued above, as a skill for forming joint goals and joint attention in collaborative activities","tomasello2012two"
"recursive mindreading",">","conventions","","Cultural Evolution","cultural evolution","hypothesis","","mindreading helps in forming conventions to be followed jointly","tomasello2012two"
"population growth in groups",">","cultural practices","","Cultural Evolution","cultural evolution","hypothesis","","Cultural practices are thus conventionalizations (standardizations) of the small-scale collaborative (and other) activities","tomasello2012two"

"cultural practices",">","behavioural markers of group identity","","Cultural evolution","cultural evolution","hypothesis","","individuals displaying various markers of group identity that indicate to all that they grew up in this tribe and share its cultural practices and values. Contemporary humans have many diverse ways of doing this, but one can imagine that the original ways were mainly behavioral: people who talk like me, prepare food like me, and net fish in the conventional way—that is, those who share my cultural practices—are very likely members of my society","tomasello2012two"

"collective knowledge",">","collaborations","","Cultural evolution","cultural evolution","hypothesis","","","tomasello2012two"
"collaborations",">","group identity","","Cooperation","cultural evolution","hypothesis","","t group identification is a scaled-up version of the “we” intentionality that small-scale groups of foragers might have experienced previously as they hunted or gathered collaboratively toward a joint goal.","tomasello2012two"
"group identity",">","collective intentionality","","Cooperation","cultural evolution","hypothesis",""," groupmindedness—underlain by skills and motivations not just of joint intentionality with other individuals in the moment, but of collective intentionality with the society as a whole","tomasello2012two"
"competition between groups",">","division of labour","","Cooperation","cultural evolution","hypothesis","","To compete, the society as a whole—especially as population increased and there was increasing division of labor—had to scale up its small-scale collaboration to form collective, society-wide goals, plans, and collective knowledge of things in the face of outside threats.","tomasello2012two"
"altruism",">","direct","","Altruism","cultural evolution","hypothesis","","direct interest to help others who might be future partners.","tomasello2012two"
"altruism",">","indirect","","Altruism","cultural evolution","hypothesis","","when the target domain is collaboration, then what is being socially selected for is good collaborators—who are tolerant of others in cofeeding situations, skillful at coordination and communication, have a tendency to shun or punish free riders, help their partners, and so on.","tomasello2012two"
