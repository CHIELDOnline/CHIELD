"regularization bias",">","grammatical regularization","pos","language acquisition","language change","experiment","yes","""We found several biases at work during learning in our experiment. The regularization bias, favoring grammars with less variation, had the effect of generally pushing the grammars inferred by learners to be more regular, i.e., less variable"", but only towards word orders which do not have a substantive bias against them.","culbertson2012learning"
"lexical access: nouns",">","noun-initial word order","pos","linguistic typology","language change","experiment","no","""Further, we can clearly also rule out the opposite prediction (5 of (11)), that faster lexical retrieval of nouns produces a general preference for noun-first order""","culbertson2012learning"
"probabilistic substantive learning biases",">","shift away from dispreferred grammars","pos","language acquisition","language change","experiment","yes","``Additional biases were also at work: one led learners to prefer harmonic ordering patterns (in this case, those which preserve the position of the noun with respect to both modifier types); the other disfavored the particular non-harmonic pattern 4 which combines Adj- Noun order with Noun-Num order...This substantive bias mirrors a typological generalization—Greenberg’s Universal 18—suggesting that at least some cross-linguistic regularities may have their origin in the biases of learners...Although crosslinguistic typology is certainly the result of many interacting factors, our results suggest that a learning bias should be part of any explanation for this generalization.''","culbertson2012learning"
"probabilistic substantive learning biases",">","grammatical regularization","pos","language acquisition","language change","experiment","yes","""In the best characterization of the bias derived from the Bayesian model of learners in the experiment, the distinction between the two non-harmonic patterns is discrete and decisive: the bias places exactly zero probability on pattern 4—yielding no regularization for that pattern—but a non-zero probability on pattern 3 that is sufficient to generate considerable regularization""","culbertson2012learning"
