"lexicon: valence",">","lexicon:frequency of use","pos","","language change","statistical","","emotional content affects the word frequency such that positive words appear more frequently. This points towards an emotional bias in used language and supports Pollyanna hypothesis, which asserts that there is a bias towards the usage of positive words.","garcia2012positive"
"word length","~","lexicon: information content","pos","","language change","statistical","","we found that the correlation coefficient between word length and self-information is positive, showing that word length increases with self-information.","garcia2012positive"
"arousal","/>","lexicon: information content","pos","","language change","statistical","","we calculated Pearson's and Spearman's correlation coefficients between the absolute value of the valence and the self-information of a word ... The dependence between valence and self-information disappears if we ignore the sign of the valence, which means, indeed, that the usage frequency of a word is not just related to the overall emotional intensity, but to the positive or negative emotion expressed by the word.","garcia2012positive"
"lexicon: valence","~","lexicon: information content","neg","","language change","statistical","","Controlling for word length, we find that the correlation between information and valence does not depend on the length,i.e. it is indeed the usage frequency that matters.","garcia2012positive"
"lexicon:frequency of use",">","lexicon: information content","neg","","language change","statistical","","positive sentences would become more frequent and even advance to a social norm (cf. 'Have a nice day'), but they would provide less information when ex-pressed. ' Words with negative emotions are less often used, but because oftheir rareness they carry more information.","garcia2012positive"
"lexicon: valence",">","prosociality","pos","","cultrual evolution","review","","according to Rime (2009), the expression of positive emotions increases the level of communication and strengthens social links. ","garcia2012positive"
"prosociality",">","cooperation","pos","","cultrual evolution","review","","the expression of positive emotions increases the level of communication and strengthens social links. This would lead to stronger pro-social behaviour and cooper-ation, giving evolutionary advantage to societies whose communication shows a positivebias.","garcia2012positive"
