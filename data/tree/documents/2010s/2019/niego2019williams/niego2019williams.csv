"self-domestication",">","visuo-spatial cognition","neg","","","","","One important parallel between WS and DS concerns visuospatial abilities, which are reported to be severely impaired in WS (Bellugi and Wang, 1994; Meyer-Lindenberg et al., 2004; Mobbs et al., 2007; Atkinson and Braddick, 2011; Haas and Reiss, 2012). Usually, people with WS experience problems with seeing the ‘big picture’ made out of smaller components, like a triangle composed of circles (Wang et al., 1995).","niego2019williams"
"self-domestication",">","hpa axis","","","","","","The HPA axis is a major neuroendocrine system resulting from complex interactions between the hypothalamus, the pituitary gland, and the adrenal glands, and regulates a great number of bodily functions. In Belyaev’s seminal farm fox experiment, it was shown that the function of the HPA axis was significantly reduced in domesticated foxes in just a few generations, resulting in decreased levels of glucocorticoids, decreased levels of basal adrenocorticotropic hormone in plasma, and reduced adrenal response to stress, which plausibly accounts for the changes in behavior linked to domestication (Naumenko and Belyaev, 1980; Oskina, 1996; Trut et al., 2009). A decreased stress response of the HPA axis was later found in other domesticated animals, like rats and guinea pigs (Kruska, 1988; Künzl and Sachser, 1999; Trut et al., 2009). Specifically, Kaiser et al. (2015) found that although cortisol levels in guinea pigs were similar in wild and domestic strains when it came to basal cortisol activity, the wild strain of cavies exhibited a more pronounced cortisol response when introduced to new environments (Künzl and Sachser, 1999; Künzl et al., 2003; Zipser et al., 2014). The HPA axis also plays a key role in the amygdala response and fear signaling impulses, which also contribute importantly to the behavioral phenotype of domesticated animals. ","niego2019williams"
"self-domestication",">","sexual maturation","pos","","","","","Subjects with WS exhibit some other features typically found in domesticated mammals, like the acceleration of sexual maturation. Pankau et al. (1992) ","niego2019williams"
"self-domestication",">","attentive behavior","pos","","","","","Domesticated animals (dogs vs. wolves, domestic vs. wild foxes, and bonobos vs. chimpanzees) show more attentiveness and sensitivity to human social cues (Hare, 2017). These cues are usually eye or facial movements or gestures. ","niego2019williams"
"self-domestication",">","brain size","neg","","","","","All in all, when one looks at anatomically-modern humans (AMHs) in comparison to our primate relatives, but also extinct hominins like Neanderthals, we exhibit reduced cranial robusticity, reduced brain size, reduced tooth size, juvenile cranial shape retained in adulthood, reduced sexual dimorphism, and differences in temperament resulting in less aggressive behaviors (Shea, 1989; Leach, 2003; Somel et al., 2009; Zollikofer and Ponce de León, 2010; Herrmann et al., 2011; Plavcan, 2012; Márquez et al., 2014; Fukase et al., 2015; Stringer, 2016; Thomas and Kirby, 2018),","niego2019williams"
"self-domestication",">","aggression","neg","","","","","With no external controlling factor triggering the domestication process, it seems that human self -domestication was mostly due to selection against aggression, when humans started to sexually select for non-threatening, less emotionally reactive partners, as a result of the rise of community living, co-parenting and other social factors (Belyaev, 1969; Trut, 1999; Hare et al., 2012; Thomas, 2014; Wilkins et al., 2014)","niego2019williams"
"self-domestication",">","elfin face","pos","","","","","People with WS exhibit a distinctive “elfin face,” resulting from a short philtrum, pointy ears with longer and narrower conchae, shorter noses with a nose bridge that is flatter than normal, wide mouth, and wideset eyes (Hovis and Butler, 1997; Pober, 2003; Tarjan et al., 2003; Morris, 2010; Poornima et al., 2012).","niego2019williams"
"self-domestication",">","gaze attention","pos","","","","","Hare et al. (2002) to speculate that the process of domestication might create selective pressures for certain social cognition skills only, especially those related to gaze attention, which enable domesticated animals to better communicate with humans. Interestingly, individuals with WS excel in following an experimenter’s gaze to the correct target, although they underperform in the subsequent tasks because they remain fixated on the face and eyes of the experimenter (Riby et al., 2013).","niego2019williams"
"self-domestication",">","anxiety disorders","pos","","","","","That said, they also experience difficulties with interpreting social cues, sustaining social relationships, and converting empathy into helpful behavior or other types of socially appropriate responses (Plesa Skwerer and Tager-Flusberg, 2016). This might explain the high prevalence of anxiety disorders in people with WS and the reported feelings of isolation despite their attempts to connect with other people (Leyfer et al., 2009; Järvinen and Bellugi, 2013).","niego2019williams"
"self-domestication",">","depigmentation","pos","","","","","Likewise, most individuals with the syndrome exhibit less pigmentation in their eyes, as most of them have blue eyes and/or a characteristic “star pattern” in the iris (Jones and Smith, 1975; Greenberg and Lewis, 1988; Holmström et al., 1990).","niego2019williams"
"self-domestication",">","growth retardation","pos","","","","","","niego2019williams"
"self-domestication",">","ear shape","n-m","","","","","Although domestication usually involves selection for tameness, it results in a distinctive set of common features affecting the body and behavior, dubbed ‘the domestication syndrome’ (DS), including floppy ears, shorter muzzles/noses, smaller teeth, smaller jaws, increased docility, earlier sexual maturation and more frequent estrous cycles, reduced sexual dimorphism, neoteny (retention of juvenile characteristics into adulthood), and smaller brains and reduced cranial capacity (Wilkins et al., 2014). These traits are not always present in all domesticated animals, but there are enough incidences of them in enough species to cause us to believe that they are connected to domestication in some way.
