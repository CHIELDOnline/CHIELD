"vertical transmission",">","age of acquisition","pos","","language change","review","","During early language acquisition, the child must first replicate the care-giver�s language structure, which is consistent with earlier acquired words being more stably represented in the language.

For instance, change as a consequence of contact between languages, or as a process of incrementation to define a social group (Labov, 2007), requires exposure to those language structures in the first place between interlocutors.

"lexicon:frequency of use",">","lexical access","pos","","language change","hypothesis","","higher-frequency words may be stably present in speakers� vocabulary because of their greater fidelity of representation and the importance of avoiding frequent confusion between speakers (Pagel et al., 2007)","monaghan2019cognitive"
"word length",">","lexical access","neg","","language change","review","","due to longer words being less accurately represented than shorter words in models of memory and lexical access (e.g., Davies, Arnell, Birchenough, Grimmond, & Houlson, 2017).","monaghan2019cognitive"
"communicative need",">","word innovation","pos","","language change","review","","Monaghan�s (2014) analysis showed that word forms acquired early in language development are less prone to change,  and suggested that innovations in the forms of words, driving language evolution of the vocabulary, are more likely to occur in terms of communication between proficient speakers of the language (Bybee & Slobin, 1982; Joseph, 1992; Slobin, 2005) ","monaghan2019cognitive"
"word innovation",">","lexical change","pos","","language change","review","","A more direct approach to identifying vocabulary change than cladistics studies is to investigate the inclusion of loan words into a language, as a process of borrowing between languages (Bloomfield, 1933; Haspelmath & Tadmor, 2009; Thomason & Kaufman, 1988).","monaghan2019cognitive"
"part of speech",">","lexical access","","","language change","review","","Pagel et al. (2007) then discovered that the grammatical category of the word was highly related to rate of lexical change of a word � words that were nouns had a higher rate of change than words from other grammatical categories, and function words had the lowest rate of change. ","monaghan2019cognitive"
"lexical access",">","representational stability","pos","","language change","review","","For instance, studies of cognates across languages have demonstrated that particular psycholinguistic properties of a word can predict the stability or volatility of its form, suggesting how cognitive processes involved in language representation and language acquisition may result in language change (Monaghan, 2014). ","monaghan2019cognitive"
"representational stability",">","word innovation","pos","","language change","review","","These results are compatible with the observations of Monaghan (2014) for stability and volatility of a word�s form relating to its length and age of acquisition: longer, later-acquired words are more vulnerable to change. ","monaghan2019cognitive"
"horizontal transmission",">","word innovation","pos","","language change","review","","In later stages of acquisition, the child then begins the process of �incrementation� of the language, where innovations and adaptations can occur � supported by observations of a greater rate of lexical change for later acquired vocabulary items. ","monaghan2019cognitive"
"part of speech",">","word innovation","","","language change","review","","Such effects of grammatical category are consistent with greater difficulty of borrowing a word when it requires adaptation to the syntax and morphology of the recipient language (Myers-Scotton, 1993). grammatical category and frequency (Bybee, 2007) predicted greater lexical change.","monaghan2019cognitive"

"concreteness",">","lexical access","pos","","language change","review","","borrowing may be facilitated for concrete words compared to abstract words, since they are recognised and retrieved faster and more accurately (Strain, Patterson, & Seidenberg, 1995; Walker & Hulme, 1999), they may be more similar in meaning between languages (Van Hell & De Groot, 1998), and they may be borrowed alongside their physical referents (e.g., during trade).","monaghan2019cognitive"
