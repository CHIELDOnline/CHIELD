We identify six domesticate names forming cognate sets with regular sound correspondences in at least two of the branches identified in our phylogenetic analysis: foxtail millet, pig, sheep, rice plant, cattle, and horse (SI Appendix, section 5). The fact that, archaeologically, all of these first appear in northern China, even those with cognate sets lacking a Chinese member, is a strong indication that, early in its expansion phase, the Sino-Tibetan family was located in that broad area (Fig. 1), now occupied by Sinitic languages. In particular, under our root date of ca. 7,200 yBP, broomcorn millet, foxtail millet, rice, pigs, and sheep are early enough to have played a demography-boosting role in the early stages of Sino-Tibetan expansion, although we do not think rice was known to ancestral Sino-Tibetan speakers. The northeastern part of the Sino-Tibetan domain is thus the family’s most likely homeland. Alternative proposals such as Sichuan (26), eastern India (16), and the Tibetan plateau (36) lack an archaeologically and demographically supported account of the family’s expansion.","Sagart10317"
