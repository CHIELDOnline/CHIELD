"population size","~","entropy rates","pos","","language change","statistical","yes","there is a strong and significant positive correlation between the entropy rate and the speaker population size. From an information-theoretic point of view, this observation implies that languages with more speakers tend to be less redundant and therefore more complex.","koplenig2019language"
"population size",">","variation in learning sets","pos","","language change","logical","","in languages with only few speakers, the current generation learns the language from a smaller set of individuals, who have had a greater chance to interact with each other and have a greater chance of having learned the language from the same individuals, compared to speech communities with many members. In the latter case, language learners will experience more variation in the input they receive. ","koplenig2019language"
"variation in learning sets",">","entropy rates","pos","","language change","hypothesis","","This greater input variation, in turn, could lead to a gradual accumulation of variable statistical structure that could be reflected in more information-theoretic uncertainty (i.e. entropy) for languages with more speakers.","koplenig2019language"
"entropy rates",">","L1 learnability","pos","","language change","hypothesis","","One corollary of this mechanism would be that (the statistical structure of) languages with more speakers should, on average, be harder to learn. ","koplenig2019language"

"population size","~","morphological complexity","neg","","language change","statistical","yes","that there is a weak but significant negative Spearman correlation between the morphological complexity index and the speaker population size that still passes the permutation test after partialling out the influence of the L2 proportion","koplenig2019language"
"proportion of L2 learners","/>","entropy rates","pos","","language change","statistical","","The entropy rate correlates significantly with the L2 proportion (cf. row 4); however, when the effect of the speaker population size is removed, the resulting correlation coefficient is sharply reduced by a factor of roughly 3.5 to less than 0.09. In conjunction with the other results presented in this paper and as electronic supplementary material, the empirical evidence does not support a relationship between the two variables.","koplenig2019language"
"entropy rates","/>","morphological complexity","pos","","language change","statistical","","there is no noteworthy negative correlation between morphological complexity and entropy rates. This result challenges the idea that linguistic redundancy that arises from morphological specification covaries with information-theoretic redundancy as assumed by Lupyan & Dale (2018), Nettle (2012) and Lupyan & Dale (2015)","koplenig2019language"
"population size",">","proportion of L2 learners","pos","","language change","statistical","","vehicularity [(languages with many L2 speakers)] should be a significant predictor of morphological and information-theoretic complexity after controlling for the influence of estimated speaker population size. ... vehicularity correlates positively with the logged speaker populations size (r = 0.474) and logged geographical range size (r = 0.373).","koplenig2019language"
"vehicularity","~=","proportion of L2 learners","pos","","language change","logical","","a language is categorized as vehicular, if it is used as an L2 in addition to being used as an L1. This information can be used to indirectly gain information about the proportion of L2 users","koplenig2019language"
