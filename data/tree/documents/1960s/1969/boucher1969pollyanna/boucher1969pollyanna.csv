The answer surely goes beyond psycholinguistics per se and into the nature of human social structures and the conditions under which these structures can be maintained. It is hard to imagine human groups whose members persistently look for and talk about the ugly things in life and in their neigh- bors long remaining together. ","boucher1969pollyanna"

This could be due, in part, to the direct opera- tion of Pollyannaism in humans, but it could also be due to the greater availability of E+ qualifiers in the adult language.'","boucher1969pollyanna"

"lexicon: valence",">","lexical change","pos",NA,"language change","hypothesis",NA,"The Pollyanna Hypothesis leads to the pre- diction that, for human languages generally, negative affixes will be applied to E+ words (to make E- opposites) more frequently than to E- words (to make E+ opposites). This is because the hypothesis assumes priority of E+ words in appearance in a language historically as well as in the development of language in individuals--and negative affixes must be applied to already existent meaningful forms.","boucher1969pollyanna"
