"information pooling",">","raw material transport: large distances",NA,"","coevolution","hypothesis",NA,"""After about 1.0 million years ago there was a large increase in raw-material transfer distances, possibly a result of the emergence of the ability to pool information by using a protolanguage"" (p. 67); ""Raw-material transfer distances for non-modern hominids 1.9â€“0.2 million years ago show an increase at about 1.0 million years ago, indicating the emergence of a protolanguage, the ability to negotiate face-to-face and to pool information in a local group"" (p. 68); ""Distances of raw-material transfer by Pleistocene hominids show three important stages that relate to language ability. The first stage begins at about 1.9 million years ago with a maximum raw-material transfer distance of 13 km and shows early hominids to have had a capacity for planning greater than chimpanzees. The second stage occurs at about 1.0 million years ago when the maximum transfer distance increases to 100 km, suggesting the presence of a protolanguage that facilitates pooling of information"" (p. 78)","marwick2003pleistocene"
"protolanguage",">","raw material transport: large distances",NA,"","coevolution","hypothesis",NA,"""Protolanguage is harder to define, but probably included basic symbolic reference to perceived phenomena and the ability to communicate about them in simple topic-comment strings. Protolanguage need not have syntax, the ability to express displacement or regular context-free symbol use. I argue here that protolanguage possessed long-term stability but limited expressive power and that extensive use of symbols was not common amongst protolanguage speakers"" (p. 68)","marwick2003pleistocene"
