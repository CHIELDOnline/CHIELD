Both evolutionary tracks thus urge each other on by positive feedback, as upgraded neurological capacity allows more complex and diversified language systems to evolve, which in turn select for more sophisticated neurological platforms.","evans2003context"
"complexity and diversification",">","australian linguistic structures","","Cultural Structuration of Language","cultural evolution","experiment","yes","Australian groups are remarkable for the ways they organize linguistic variation to systematically index differences in social group membership, often resulting in overarching systems of sociolinguistic differentiation that go beyond the boundaries of any single language.","evans2003context"
