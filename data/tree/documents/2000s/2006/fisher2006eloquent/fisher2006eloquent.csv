"imitation",">","vocal learning","","","cultural evolution","hypothesis","","""Many species use innately specified calls, but a few acquire new vocalizations through the imitation of peers, including three groups of birds (parrots, hummingbirds and song-birds) and at least three groups of mammals (humans, cetaceans and bats).""","fisher2006eloquent"
"gene: ASPM",">","brain size","","","preadaptation","hypothesis","","""Many genes might participate in modulating brain size, including two genes...MCPH1 (the gene that encodes microcephalin) and ASPM (abnormal-spindle-like, microcephaly associated) have been the subject of the most intensive evolutionary study following their association with primary microcephaly, which is a rare human condition of reduced brain size.Patterns of betweenspecies and within-species divergence indicate that these two genes underwent positive selection during primate evolution, albeit with acceleration of coding change peaking at different times.""","fisher2006eloquent"
"gene: Microcephalin",">","brain size","","","preadaptation","hypothesis","","""Therefore, a close examination of between- and within-species diversity is warranted, as it can reveal whether alteration of the gene in question was involved in human evolution. For example, studies of primary microcephaly — a disorder of reduced brain size — have suggested mechanisms that could have contributed to cortical expansion during primate evolution.""","fisher2006eloquent"
"language acquisition","<=>","brain size","","","coevolution","hypothesis","","""So, the relevant susceptibility genes, once identified, could be informative for understanding the evolution of social cognition and how this relates to language origins.""","fisher2006eloquent"
"brain size",">","communication","","","language change","hypothesis","","""Neuroscientists who seek to understand the neural basis of human communication have tended to focus their attention on two regions of the cerebral cortex that were thought to provide specialized human-specific substrates for processing language — Broca’s area (commonly described as the seat of grammar) and Wernicke’s area (described as the seat of meaning and sound structure).""","fisher2006eloquent"
"gene: FOXP2",">","language deficits","","","","","","""Independent chromosomal aberrations (including translocations and deletions) that disrupt FOXP2 are associated with speech and language deficits.""","fisher2006eloquent"
