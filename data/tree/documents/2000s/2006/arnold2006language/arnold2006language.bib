  title={Language evolution: semantic combinations in primate calls},
  abstract={Syntax sets human language apart from other natural communication systems, although its evolutionary origins are obscure1. Here we show that free-ranging putty-nosed monkeys combine two vocalizations into different call sequences that are linked to specific external events, such as the presence of a predator and the imminent movement of the group. Our findings indicate that non-human primates can combine calls into higher-order sequences that have a particular meaning.},
