"vocal control",">>","protolanguage","pos","language origin","preadaptation","hypothesis","yes","'We think vocal and articulatory control, which may be relevant to the evolution of song as well as speech (Merker 2000), evolved as a precursive step in the construction of language (MacNeilage 1998; Studdert-Kennedy 1998; 2005)' pg. 260","locke2006language"
"infancy",">","voluntary vocalisations","pos","language acquisition","language change","review","yes","'In the first phase of development, vocal learning, infants learn and may reproduce aspects of the prosodic and segmental characteristics of the ambient language.' pg. 261","locke2006language"
"infancy",">","linguistic creativity","pos","language acquisition","language change","review","yes","'Around the end of the first year, most infants attempt to speak, and may even – then or in succeeding months – improvise sound-meaning relationships that may be treated by the family as invented words' pg. 261","locke2006language"
"linguistic creativity",">","voluntary vocalisations","pos","language acquisitition","language change","review","yes","'A few months later, infants develop a suite of cognitive traits that will enable language to be used at a basal level of creativity and efficiency. These center on the ability to infer, and the disposition to share, the intentions of others (Tomasello et al. 2005). Around this time, several different communicative acts begin to emerge, with many in frequent use by age three or four years (Snow et al. 1996; Wetherby et al. 1988; also see the review in Adams 2002).' pg. 261","locke2006language"
"voluntary vocalisations",">","phonetic change","pos","language change","language change","hypothesis","","'These interactions can produce durable changes of adult speech, changes that we have termed “trickle up phonetics” (Locke 2004b).' pg. 266","locke2006language"
"voluntary vocalisations",">","parental support","pos","","language change","hypothesis","","The hypothesis also envisions that infants who cooed and babbled at appropriate intervals were more likely to engage with adults, to be liked by them, to receive more sophisticated forms of care as infancy progressed, and to generate and learn complex phonetic patterns.' pg. 266","locke2006language"
"parental support",">","evolutionary fitness","pos","language change","language change","hypothesis","","'Further elaboration of vocal repertoires, we propose, would have occurred later in development under different pressures, potentially enhancing fitness in one or more of these stages, particularly adolescence.' pg. 266","locke2006language"
"childhood length",">","verbal ability","pos","language acquisition","language change","hypothesis","","'We propose that individuals with longer intervals between infancy and adolescence would have had more opportunity to improvise and learn vocal material, and any rules of deployment. Selection for vocal ability and, ultimately, for language, would thus have worked reciprocally to extend childhood.' pg. 263","locke2006language"
"verbal ability",">","evolutionary fitness","pos","origin of language","coevolution","hypothesis","none","'With a premium in this context on honest signaling, benefits would have accrued to families that were able to deploy these more complex forms meaningfully, and thereby to warn, advise, and inform each other.' pg. 260","locke2006language"
"childhood length",">","maternal reproductive output","pos","","language change","hypothesis","none","'The evolutionary value of childhood lies in the mother’s freedom to discontinue nursing her three-year-old, which enabled her to initiate a new pregnancy. Doing so enhanced reproductive output without increasing the risk of mortality for the mother, or her infant or older children, for in cooperatively breeding societies others were available to help care for the young.' pg. 262","locke2006language"
"bipedalism",">","childhood length","pos","","language change","review","yes","'If we apply Gottlieb’s model here, bipedalism is seen as a key event in Stage I, for this was a new behavior that, in time, produced pelvic narrowing. Remodeling of the birth canal caused a shift of skull and brain development into the postnatal period, increasing the degree and duration of infant helplessness.' pg. 277","locke2006language"
"evolutionary fitness",">","childhood length","pos","origin of langauge","coevolution","hypothesis","","'We propose that in evolutionary history, growth factors working in concert with selection for repro ductive success initially produced a short childhood that was later used for, and extended by, vocal and verbal learning.' pg. 260","locke2006language"
"syntax",">>","protolanguage","pos","origin of language","preadaptation","review","no","'...it making less sense that the capacity for syntax – the focus of many proposals – evolved prior to the physical system responsible for the phonetic units that enable words and massive vocabularies (Bickerton 1995; 2000; Donald 1999; Studdert-Kennedy & Goldstein 2003), or somehow evolved without them.' pg. 260","locke2006language"
"adolescence",">","verbal ability","pos","language acquisition","language change","hypothesis","","'We suggest that although the basic structure and functions of language are instated in infancy, mastery of language as a social tool – a fluent and flexible means of oral communication, manipulation, and performance – does not approach adult levels of proficiency until adolescence.' pg. 260","locke2006language"
"adolescence",">","phonological change","pos","language change","language change","review","yes","'“The relatively high degree of phonological innovation in the adolescent age group,” wrote Eckert (1988), “is an indication that the develop ment of adolescent social structure provides a major impetus for phonological change"".' pg. 265","locke2006language"

"adolescence",">","male vocal performance","pos","language use","language change","review","","'The adolescent male attraction to verbal dueling may also be supported by physiological factors. Consider the widely attested association between testosterone and physical aggression (Dabbs 2000). Since adolescent males, who have relatively high levels of testosterone, need ways to avoid hurting themselves, it may be adaptive for them to use verbal sport and humor in place of combat (Marsh 1978).' pg. 270","locke2006language"
"male vocal performance",">","external attention","pos","language use","language change","hypothesis","yes","'This relationship between speech and power may be linked to a connection between speech and attention, one in which vocal loudness plays a role.' pg. 268","locke2006language"
"external attention",">","social status","pos","language use","language change","hypothesis","yes","'In adulthood, individuals who speak in long sentences or hold the floor for long periods of time tend to receive more gazes than others, and to be perceived as unusually powerful (Abramovitch 1976; Bales et al. 1951; Dabbs & Ruback 1984; Exline et al. 1975; Kalma 1991; Kendon & Cook 1969; Mulac 1989).' pg. 268","locke2006language"
"gossip",">","social status","pos","language use","language change","review","yes","'In gossip as well as rap, verbal skill is used to raise one’s own status, and to lower that of competitors, while also broadcasting and enforcing community standards (Abrahams 1973).' pg. 270","locke2006language"
"social status",">","sexual attractivenss","pos","societal structure","language change","hypothesis","yes","'This research suggests that women who are attracted to men with a commanding way of speaking may get a mate for themselves, and father for their children, who has high levels of testosterone and status, and unusual access to valued resources.' pg. 272","locke2006language"

"verbal ability",">","sexual attractivenss","pos","language use","language change","review","yes","'Recently, it was reported that in both men and women, opposite-sex ratings of vocal attractiveness predicted age of first sexual intercourse, number of sexual partners, number of competing sexual relationships, and number of partners that were involved in other sexual relationships (Hughes et al. 2004). The authors concluded that “voice may have been an important parameter of mate choice” in human evolution (Hughes et al. 2004, p. 303).' pg. 272","locke2006language"
