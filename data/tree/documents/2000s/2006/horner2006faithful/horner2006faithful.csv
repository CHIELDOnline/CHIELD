"social observation",">","problem solving","pos","","preadaptation","experiment","yes","""Using a powerful three-group, two-action methodology, we found that alternative methods used to obtain food from a foraging device (“lift door” versus “slide door”) were accurately transmitted along two chains of six and five chimpanzees, respectively, such that the last chimpanzee in the chain used the same method as the original trained model.""","horner2006faithful"
"social learning",">","canalization","pos","","preadaptation","experiment","yes","""Their exclusive use of only one of the two available techniques may represent a form of “canalization” (46), whereby a chimpanzee's potentially limitless exploration of a problem is focused around only a subset of behaviors that they see performed by others.""","horner2006faithful"
"emulation",">","problem solving","pos","","preadaptation","hypothesis","no","""Similarly, it is likely that half of the participants in the chains would have failed the control condition, and hence their behavior suggests a more complex social learning mechanism, such as emulation or imitation (28), but further experiments will be required to establish this.""","horner2006faithful"
