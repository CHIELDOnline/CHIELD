"recursion: ability to understand",">>","human language","pos","","preadaptation","hypothesis","no","The failure of monkeys in this test was used to support the FLN argument: the ability to extract rules from auditory sequences exists in many classes of animals, but tasks requiring recursion are solvable only by humans.","okanoya2007language"
"broca's area",">>","recursion: ability to understand","pos","","preadaptation","hypothesis","no","Although the ventral premotor cortex and the frontal operculum were activated by both tasks, Broca's area (Broadmann Area 44, BA44) was activated by the context-free grammar task only.","okanoya2007language"
"stack memory",">>","recursion: ability to understand","pos","","preadaptation","hypothesis","no","Technically, if context-free grammar is limited to recursion, an automaton that is connected with a stack memory (a ‘push-down automaton’) would be able to use such grammar [26]. A push-down automaton can handle a type 2 Chomsky hierarchy and can produce strings that have characteristics of context-free grammar. In biological terms ‘stack memory’, similar to memory performance, is often seen in animal navigation [27, 28], and the hippocampus might be involved in the underlying mechanism.","okanoya2007language"
"vocal learning",">>","human language","pos","","preadaptation","hypothesis","no","Another important and unique aspect of human language is the abundance of learned tokens","okanoya2007language"
"sensory-motor integration",">>","vocal learning","pos","","preadaptation","hypothesis","no","Vocal learning involves an extended sensory–motor interface system and involvement of generally autonomic (respiration) [41] and generally emotional (vocalization) [42] systems under intentional, cortical control","okanoya2007language"
"sensory-motor integration",">","general intelligence","pos","","preadaptation","hypothesis","no"," This completes a sensory–motor loop with cortical control. Such a system is likely to stimulate general growth of cortical areas and promote an increase in general intellect","okanoya2007language"
"general intelligence",">","social interaction","pos","","preadaptation","hypothesis","no","Such a system is likely to stimulate general growth of cortical areas and promote an increase in general intellect [44] which, in turn, enables more complicated social tactics. ","okanoya2007language"
"social interaction",">","cooperation","pos","Cooperation","preadaptation","hypothesis","no","Such a system is likely to stimulate general growth of cortical areas and promote an increase in general intellect [44] which, in turn, enables more complicated social tactics. In such a society, advanced systems for communication, deception and cooperation should emerge.","okanoya2007language"
