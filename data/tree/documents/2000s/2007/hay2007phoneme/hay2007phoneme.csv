"population size","<=>","phoneme inventory size","pos","","none","statistical","none","We have reported a positive correlation between how many phonemes a language has and how many speakers it has. This correlation exists both within the vowel inventory and within the consonant inventory. This is not an artifact of language family. We do not know what the underlying causes of this correlation are. But it is certainly intriguing, and we hope that this report will generate some discussion of the possible causes of such a relationship.","hay2007phoneme"
