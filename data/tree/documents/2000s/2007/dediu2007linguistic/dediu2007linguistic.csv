"language acquisition",">","language change","none","historical linguistics","language change","review","none","It is generally acknowledged (22) that the process of language acquisition plays a major role in historical language change: language acquirers construct a grammar based on the language they hear around them, but the constructed grammar is not necessarily identical to that of their models, and the cumulative effect of such small differences over generations leads to language change.","dediu2007linguistic"

Wong, personal communication), focusing on the relationship between the anatomy of the primary auditory cortex and linguistic tone learning, found that the successful learners showed greater volume of left, but not right, Heschl's Gyrus, especially for gray matter.","dediu2007linguistic"

"gene: ASPM","~","tone","none","genetics; phonetics","none","statistical","none","Focusing on the distribution of Pearson's r for all pairs of linguistic features and alleles, we found that the correlations between tone and ASPM-D and between tone and MCPH-D are both highly significant (tone and ASPM-D: r = −0.53, P = 9.63 × 10−5; tone and MCPH-D: r = −0.54, P = 7.22 × 10−5) and their values are in the top 1.5% of the empirical distribution of correlations.  This result shows that, taken individually, tone and ASPM-D and tone and MCPH-D are highly significantly correlated and the strength of their relationship is >98.5% of all of the 25,558 correlations between linguistic features and alleles in our database.","dediu2007linguistic"
