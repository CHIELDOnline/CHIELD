"merge",">","language: internalised","","","coevolution","hypothesis","","""An account of the evolution of language will have to deal with the property of unbounded Merge, and whatever else remains in UG, the genetic endowment""; ""the ‘emergence’ was the capacity for recursive generation in its simplest possible form: the operation Merge, linked to atomic conceptual resources to create a ‘language of thought’, perhaps near optimally. That exaptation would indeed have been adaptive, and could well have come to dominate the particular population of the human lineage in which it occurred.""","chomsky2007biolinguistic"

"genes",">","merge","","","preadaptation","hypothesis","","""The core principle of language, unbounded Merge, must have arisen from some rewiring of the brain, presumably not too long before the ‘great leap forward’, and hence very recently in evolutionary time. Such changes take place in an individual, not a group. The individual so endowed would have had many advantages: capacities for complex thought, planning, interpretation, and so on. The capacity would be transmitted to offspring, coming to dominate a small breeding group. At that stage, there would be an advantage to externalization, so the capacity would be linked as a secondary process to the sensorimotor system for externalization and interaction""","chomsky2007biolinguistic"
