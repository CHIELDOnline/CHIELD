"orthographic neighbourhood size",">","lexical competition","pos","","language change","statistical","","[According to] the interactive activation framework, there are inhibitory connections between lexical candidates, and so there should be more within-level inhibition from words that have more orthographic overlap, that is, orthographic neighbors.","balota2004visual"
"lexical competition",">","lexical decision","neg","","language change","review","","With young adults, there is a replication of the original Coltheart et al. (1977) observation. Specifically, thereis no evidence of a unique neighborhood size main effect across a large set of single-syllable words, but there is evidence of a large inhibitory effect for nonwords that are based on these words. However, the null neighborhood size effect in young adults is qualified by a significant interaction between neighborhood size and log frequency (p < .01), which we tested by entering the product of the two predictor variables in a third step, as described above.

"orthographic neighbourhood size",">","speeded naming","pos","","language change","statistical","","studies by Andrews (1989, 1992), Grainger (1990), andLaxon, Coltheart, and Keating (1988) have all found facilitatory effects of neighborhood size on speeded naming performance. In the present naming results, neighborhood size produced a highly reliable and unique predictive effect in both young adults and older adults.","balota2004visual"

"lexicon: imagability",">","speeded naming","neg","","language change","statistical",""," there was also a consistent effect of imageability on speeded naming performance. This was highlighted by the imageability norms developed by Cortese and Fugett (2003) on the full set of items. This effect occurred in both the item- and subject-level analyses.","balota2004visual"
