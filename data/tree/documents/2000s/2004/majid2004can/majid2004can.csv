"linguistic diversity","<=>","cognitive diversity","","Frame of Reference","cultural evolution","review","yes","linguistic diversity aligns with cognitive diversity, as shown in people’s language independent solutions to spatial tasks and un-selfconscious gestures accompanying speech; Rather than cognitive categories being universal and giving rise to universal semantic categories, as is typically supposed, it seems that cognitive categories are variable and they align with cross-linguistically variable semantic categories","majid2004can"
