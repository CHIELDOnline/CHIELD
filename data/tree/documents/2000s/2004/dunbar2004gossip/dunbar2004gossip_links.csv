population size: ancient,>,freeriders,pos,,coevolution,review,,"free riders become increasingly more intrusive as social group sizes increase or society becomes more dispersed, principally because under each of these conditions free riders benefit from having large numbers of naive individuals whom they can exploit (Enquist & Leimar, 1993)",dunbar2004gossip
episodic memory,>,freeriders,neg,,coevolution,hypothesis,,The control of free riders is largely dependent on memory of past events (occasions on which they have cheated us or reneged on implicit contracts) and an appreciation of how they might afflict others (which depends on sophisticated cognitive abilities such as theory of mind).,dunbar2004gossip

predation risk,>,population size: ancient,pos,,coevolution,review,,"For monkeys and apes, predators are the single most important factor influencing group size: As a species•À_ ecological habits expose it to increased risk of attack by predators, so its group size must be proportionately larger to protect its members (for reviews, see Dunbar, 1988, 1996a)",dunbar2004gossip
