"climate: temperature",">","phoneme inventory: number of vowels","pos","","language change","statistical","","as before, speakers in warm-climate languages have been found to use relatively more vowels (and thus more high-sonority sounds) than do speakers of the languages of cold climates.","Munroeetal2009"
"climate: temperature",">","phoneme inventory: number of rhotics","pos","","language change","statistical","","languages in warm climatic zones possess more of the consonant classes exhibiting moderate levels of sonority (rhotic consonants, laterals, nasals)","Munroeetal2009"

"phoneme inventory: number of vowels",">","sonority","pos","","language change","statistical","","The high sonority (audibility) of the vowel, and its adaptive value under certain conditions, have been invoked to account for its greater frequency in warmer climates. ","Munroeetal2009"
"phoneme inventory: number of rhotics",">","sonority","pos","","language change","statistical","","Successively lower places on the [sonority] scale are occupied by other vowels and semivowels, then by rhotic consonants, laterals, nasals (all with some of the qualities of vowels, and here termed sonorant consonants),","Munroeetal2009"

"vocal motor production",">","number of vowels","pos","","language change","statistical","","high/nonback vowels occur disproportionately often in cold-climate languages. (In all languages, almost every utterance contains a vowel, thus some vowel sound will appear in any given syllable or word.) Of the vowels, high/nonback sounds are markedly the lowest in sonority (Table 1), and, in featuring such vowels, cold-climate languages approach their pattern of displaying typically low-sonority sound types.","Munroeetal2009"
"sexual expressiveness","~","phoneme inventory: number of rhotics","n-m","","language change","statistical","no","Ember and Ember (2007a) have demonstrated that total linguistic-sonority scores are predicted by a variety of factors besides climate. These variables include plant cover, mountainous terrain, and sexual restrictiveness. Other relevant variables in this line of inquiry have been literacy and degree of baby holding. However, zero-order correlations between our individual sonority classes and all these variables indicate little beyond chance outcomes, with only 11% of all runs being significant, and no single class being significantly related to the above variables more than twice. The inference seems clear that the embersÕ results apply not to the constituent classes of sound but to overall sonority scores, which are nevertheless still related to climatic zones.","Munroeetal2009"
