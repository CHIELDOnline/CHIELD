"gene: FOXP2",">","specific language impairment: verbal and orofacial dyspraxia",NA,"",NA,"hypothesis",NA,"""By contrast, individuals carrying heterozygous FOXP2 mutations have difficulties mastering complex sequences of mouth movements underlying speech (developmental verbal dyspraxia), and have impaired expressive and receptive language, whereas other aspects of cognition and development are relatively spared.""","fisher2009foxp2"
"gene: FOXP2",">","synaptic plasticity",NA,"",NA,"hypothesis",NA,"""On performing electrophysiological examinations of key neural Foxp2-expression sites known to be important for motor-skill learning, Groszer et al. [38] found abnormalities in synaptic plasticity.""","fisher2009foxp2"
"gene: FOXP2",">","vocal learning",NA,"",NA,"hypothesis",NA,"""Reduced functional FoxP2 protein seems to yield speech and language deficits in humans, impaired vocal learning in songbirds.""","fisher2009foxp2"
"gene: FOXP2",">","sensory-motor integration",NA,"",NA,"hypothesis",NA,"""Investigating the impacts of FoxP2 on animal vocalizations is another avenue to pursue. Is the gene important for the function of sensory, motor, or sensoryâ€“motor integration sites in the brain?""","fisher2009foxp2"
