"language contact vs. isolation",">","proportion of adult learners","pos","","language change","logical","","Our point of departure is previous research (e.g. Szmrecsanyi and Kortmann [2009]) according to which varieties of English – be they native L1 vernaculars, non-native L2 varieties, or English-based pidgins and creoles (P/Cs) – can be thought of as varying along two underlying dimensions of morphosyntactic variance. Crucially, Szmrecsanyi and Kortmann ([2009]) demonstrate that variety type (L1, L2, or P/C) and not, for example, geographical distance or proximity, is the best predictor of a given variety’s location relative to these two dimensions","szmrecsanyi2009between"
