"semantic size",">","lexicon: imagability","pos","","language change","hypothesis","","We suggest that a reason why bigger items might generate faster responses is related to imageability. While both bigger and smaller items can be equally highly imageable (and were in our experiment), it may be that the relative speed of accessing a stored visual representation is faster when the object is bigger. When viewed at the same distance, larger objects contain more low spatial-frequency information, which is transmitted faster through the visual system via the magnocellular pathway (e.g., Sereno, 1993). It has been established that early visual areas (lateral geniculate nucleus, primary visual cortex) are activated during mental imagery (for a review, see Kosslyn & Thompson, 2003). From an embodiment perspective, it is possible that a similar mechanism comes into play during lexical access. Thus, if visual imagery accompanies word recognition, such information may become available earlier for words that refer to larger objects and, hence, produce a processing advantage.","sereno2009size"
