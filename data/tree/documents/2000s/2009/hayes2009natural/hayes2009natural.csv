"universal grammar naturalness bias",">","learning of unnatural patterns","neg","Language acquisition","language change","experiment","yes","""The behavior of our participants clearly shows the effect of the unnatural constraints. The ability of speakers to learn unnatural constraints has been asserted before (ยง4), and our experimental findings further support such claims.... Our results are also of interest because, although they generally reflected the Law of Frequency Matching, there were notable deviations. We examined these deviations more closely through modeling: we fitted maxent grammars to both the lexical data and the wug-test responses, and, in a Monte Carlo simulation, compared the constraint weights fitted to the observed data against those expected under the null hypothesis that responses are faithfully generated by the lexicon-trained grammar. We found that unnatural constraints were underlearned, giving modest support to the idea (Wilson 2003a, Moreton 2008) that people show a learning bias against unnatural constraints.""","hayes2009natural"
"simplicity bias",">","learning of complex constraints","neg","Language acquisition","language change","model","yes","""What may be emerging is a simplicity bias; that is, for phonological generalizations that embody relatively few segments and features... The idea of a simplicity bias in phonology has a long history, going back to the feature-counting evaluation metric proposed in Chomsky and Halle (1968). We believe that further study of the kind carried out here could shed further light on how phonological learning is constrained by simplicity considerations.""","hayes2009natural"
