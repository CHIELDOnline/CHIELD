"cognitive apparatus","<=>","uniformity in language",NA,"Linguistic diversity","cultural evolution","hypothesis","yes","It is a system that is designed to deal with the following shared Hockettian design features of spoken languages: the use of the auditory-vocal channel with its specialized (neuro)anatomy, fast transmission with output-input asymmetries, multiple levels of structure (phonological, morphosyntactic, semantic) bridging sound to meaning, linearity combined with nonlinear structure (constituency and dependency), and massive reliance on inference. ","evans2009myth"
"plasticity",">","biological constraints",NA,"Linguistic diversity","coevolution","experiment","yes","Language processing relies crucially on plasticity, as evidenced by the modality switch in sign languages","evans2009myth"
"speech apparatus",">","biological constraints",NA,"Linguistic diversity","coevolution","experiment","yes","","evans2009myth"
"vocal tract",">","biological constraints",NA,"Linguistic diversity","coevolution","experiment","yes","The major biological adaptation may prove to be the obvious anatomical one, the vocal tract itself. The null hypothesis here is that all needed brain mechanisms, outside the vocal-tract adaptation for speech, were co-opted from pre-existing adaptations not specific to language","evans2009myth"
"geographical patterns",">","biological constraints",NA,"Linguistic diversity","cultural evolution","hypothesis","yes","Understanding these patterns basically involves the methods of population biology and cladistics, together with the principles that generate change and diversity","evans2009myth"

"social learning",">","cultural - historical traditions",NA,"Linguistic diversity","cultural evolution","hypothesis","yes","language systems can evolve and diversify as sociocultural products constrained by cognitive constraints on learning","evans2009myth"
"phylogenetic patterns",">","cultural - historical traditions",NA,"Linguistic diversity","cultural evolution","hypothesis","yes","Linguistic diversity is structured very largely in phylogenetic (cultural-historical) and geographical patterns","evans2009myth"

"system biases",">","cultural - historical traditions",NA,"Linguistic diversity","cultural evolution","hypothesis","yes","Some of the canalization is due to systems-biases, as when one sound change sparks off a chain of further changes to maintain signalling discreteness. ","evans2009myth"
