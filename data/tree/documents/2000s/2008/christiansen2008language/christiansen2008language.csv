As an example, consider the acquisition of the English past tense. Frequently occurring mappings, such as go ! went, are learned more easily than more infrequent mappings, such as lie ! lay. However, low-frequency patterns may be more easily learned if they overlap in part with other patterns.","christiansen2008language"
