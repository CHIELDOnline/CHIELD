"broca's area",">>","grasping mirror system","pos","cognition","preadaptation","review","yes"," 'one should associate Broca s area with multimodal language production rather than with speech alone. Such considerations led to the formulation of the mirror system hypothesis (Arbib and Rizzolatti 1997; Rizzolatti and Arbib 1998) the evolutionary basis for language parity (the more or less alignment between the meaning intended by the  speaker  and the meaning understood by the  hearer ) is provided by the evolution of brain mechanisms that support language atop the mirror system for grasping, rooting speech in communication based on manual gesture.' pg.1053","Arbib2008PrimateVG"

"ontogenetic ritualisation",">","gestures: pantomime","pos","cognition","preadaptation","review","yes","'In short, nonhuman primates have little or no capacity for vocal imitation, but apes can indeed acquire novel gestures through some combination of ontogenetic ritualization and a form of social learning akin to what we have called simple imitation (Byrne and Tanner 2006).'","Arbib2008PrimateVG"
"gestures: referential",">","gestures: pantomime","pos","cognition","preadaptation","hypothesis","yes","'Pantomime, which we see, in evolutionary terms, as building on imitation, involves (in the early stages) the repetition of some of the movements of a praxic action, but without acting on an object, as a way of communicating something about the action, object, or event concerned.' pg. 1053","Arbib2008PrimateVG"
"gestures: pantomime",">","gestures","pos","origin of language","preadaptation","review","yes","'In more detail, Arbib (2005a) argues that an ability for complex imitation unique to the human line made possible the evolution of brain mechanisms for pantomime and thence protosign, a system of conventional gestures used to formalize, disambiguate, and extend pantomime.' pg. 1054","Arbib2008PrimateVG"
"gestures",">","protolanguage","pos","origin of language","preadaptation","review","yes","'It was further hypothesized that, once protosign has established an ability for the free creation of arbitrary gestures to support an openended semantics, the capacity to use conventionalized manual communicative gestures (protosign) and the capacity to use vocal communicative gestures (protospeech) evolved together in an expanding spiral (Arbib 2005b) to support protolanguage (Arbib 2008; Bickerton 2008), ' pg. 1054","Arbib2008PrimateVG"
