"population size",">","comparative construction","pos","Morphology;Syntax","cultural evolution","hypothesis",NA,"Small tribes with an egalitarian social system and item-for-item trade do not generally indulge in competition; they often lack words for ‘compete’, ‘win’, ‘lose’ and ‘beat’ (as in a game). Such concepts are tied in with comparison — ‘John beat Felix at running’ implies ‘John ran faster than Felix’, ‘John won’ implies ‘John performed better than all the other participants’. Groups of this type have little use for the idea of ‘more than’ or ‘less than’.","dixon08comparative"
