"outsider influence in community",">","morphological complexity: inflection","neg","sociolinguistics","language change","hypothesis","yes","A straightforward hypothesis is that a language (as a social fact, that is, as  �E-language�) becomes simpler the more it has been confronted with demands of generalized  outsiders. [...] As we measure complexity relative to the generalized outsider, we expect that in the end the measure of complexity of full languages (E-languages), correlates with the amount of outsiders in the speech community history.
