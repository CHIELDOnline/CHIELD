"age of acquisition",">","lexical decision","pos","","language change","experiment","","AoA and word frequency exerted independent effects on lexical decision speed in aregression analysis that also included concept familiarity, imageability and wordlength. Hence the two variables make separate contributions to determining lexical decision speed and cannot be reduced to each other or to indirect contributions of familiarity, imageability or length. The AoA effect occurred with the objective measure and therefore does not rely upon the use of subjective ratings of wordlearning age. ... The authors believe that the current data can be accountedfor by the hypothesis developed by Brown and Watson (1987) that the locus of the AoA effect is primarily or exclusively phonological. The spoken forms of early-learned words are easier to access than the spoken forms of later-learned words. The importance of activating phonological forms in word naming is obvious: they drive the spoken response. There is also abundant evidence for an involvement ofphonological representations in lexical decision.","morrison2000real"

"lexicon: initial phoneme",">","speeded naming","","","language change","experiment","","The initial phoneme variables also played an important role in predicting word naming speed: the top four placed variables come from this group. Faster RTs were associated with initial voiced sounds (e.g. moon,van), liquids and semivowels (e.g. leaf), nasals (e.g. mouse, nurse), glottals (e.g.heart), and stop consonants (e.g. banana, kite), while slower RTs were associated with initial alveolar/post-alveolar sounds (e.g. spider, rabbit), velar sounds (e.g. gun,king), and palato-alveolar/palatal sounds (e.g. jigsaw, ship). These results are similar to the results obtained by Treimanet al. (1995).","morrison2000real"
