Abstract = {This paper presents a computational framework for studying the influence of learning on the evolution of avian communication. We conducted computer simulations for exploring the effects of different learning strategies on the evolution of bird song. Experimental results show the genetic assimilation of song repertoires as a consequence of interactions between learning and evolution.},
