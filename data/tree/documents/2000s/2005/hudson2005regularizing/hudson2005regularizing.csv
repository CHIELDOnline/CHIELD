Typically, languages that are spoken primarily by native speakers do not contain this kind of unpredictable variability, and creoles at later stages are no exception to this rule. The question addressed in our work is how learners take input that contains unpredictable variation and end up with a language that is regular","","hudson2005regularizing"
