"cladogenesis","~","lineage split","","Evolution","cultural evolution","review","yes","The fundamental process of language formation involves cladogenesis, where a single lineage splits to form two new languages. Often, as in biology, this is due to geographic separation or migration events.","atkinson2005curious"

For example, we have archaic manuscripts of ancient languages like Hittite, Homeric Greek, Sanskrit, and Mayan.","atkinson2005curious"
"horizontal gene transfer","~","linguistic borrowing","","Evolution","cultural evolution","review","yes","Horizontal gene transfer and hybridization also have a linguistic equivalent in borrowing between languages. For example, the English word mountain is borrowed from French, montagne.","atkinson2005curious"

"hybrids","~","language creoles","","Evolution","cultural evolution","review","yes","Extreme cases of contact between languages can produce a form of language “hybrid,” as in the case of some Creoles. For example, Sranan, a Creole spoken in Surinam, has elements of English, Dutch, Portuguese, and a number of African and Indian languages, although it is essentially English based.","atkinson2005curious"
"heritable units","~","lexicons, phonology, syntax","","Evolution","cultural evolution","review","yes","Just as DNA sequences contain discrete heritable units, so too do languages in their grammatical and phonological structures and their vocabularies (lexicons). These may differ from language to language and can be inherited as the languages are learned by subsequent generations. ","atkinson2005curious"

"mutation",">","natural selection","","Evolution","cultural evolution","review","yes","As in biology, mutation and drift create variation that may be subject to selection. For example, Pawley and Syder (1983) found evidence that Darwinian selection pressures have acted on English syntax.","atkinson2005curious"

"homology","~","cognate words","","Evolution","cultural evolution","review","yes","With knowledge of the processes of linguistic change, it is possible to identify homologous linguistic characters that, like homologous biological structures, indicate inheritance from a common ancestor. Cognates are words of similar meaning with systematic sound correspondences indicating they were related due to common ancestry","atkinson2005curious"
