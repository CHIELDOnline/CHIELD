"climate: temperature",">","clothing: covering limbs","neg","","cultural evolution","logical","","Tailored clothing covering the limbs and associated gear such as gloves, mittens, socks, shoes, and boots, of course, is more common among peoples of colder regions than among those of warmer zones","witkowski1985climate"
"clothing: covering limbs",">","salience: limb parts","pos","","cultural evolution","statistical","","Both sources of evidence [lowerpolysemy rates and shorter orthographic length of terms] suggest that limb parts are more salient away from the equator","witkowski1985climate"
"salience: limb parts",">","lexicon: polysemy: hand/arm","neg","","language change","hypothesis","","Presumably activities involving the manufacture, wear, and care of apparel would greatly increase appropriate cultural occasions for referring to parts, thus increasing the frequency of use and salience of these referents, and likelihood of their acquiring distinct labels","witkowski1985climate"
