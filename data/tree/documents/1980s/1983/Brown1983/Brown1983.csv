Taylor 1957).","Brown1983"
"mobility of people",">","lexical encoding of cardinal points","pos",NA,"cultural evolution","hypothesis",NA,"when people become more mobile and more often find themselves in places with which they are not intimately familiar, knowledge of pan-geographic fixed directions such as north, south, etc., becomes increasingly useful. ","Brown1983"
"contact: language",">","lexical encoding of cardinal points","pos",NA,"cultural evolution","hypothesis",NA,"Today many languages spoken by peoples of small scale societies also have terms for cardinal directions, this probably often attributable to Western influence. In some instances cardinal point terms have been directly borrowed from Western languages. In others, native terms have been extended to borrowed concepts of cardinal directionality","Brown1983"
"large scale society",">","lexical encoding of cardinal points","pos",NA,"cultural evolution","hypothesis",NA,"The general increase in societal scale and complexity over the last several millenia of human history has no doubt promoted lexical encoding of cardinal points in many of the world's languages.","Brown1983"
