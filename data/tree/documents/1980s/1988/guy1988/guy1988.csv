"desire of elites for status",">","borrowing of external prestige forms","pos","social motivations for language change","language change","review","yes","""But in modern sociolinguistic work one striking fact emerges: not a single case has been recorded of untargeted innovation originating in the highest social class! Those few cases identified in the literature of changes in progress starting at the top all involve the borrowing of some external prestige norm, i.e. targeted change. An example of such a targeted change introduced from the top is the consonantal pronunciation of post-vocalic Ixl of New York City, discussed above, which is being imported into NYC English from the socially dominant 'General American' dialect. The agents of this change are the upper classes. The important thing to notice is that this 'innovation' does not bring anything new into the language, but just involves dialectal redistribution of variants.""","guy1988"

"desire for local solidarity",">","linguistic innovations","pos","social motivations for language change","language change","review","yes","""[Labov:] Untargeted changes, on the other hand, internally developed and not borrowed, do bring in something completely new, and tend to originate among the working class...This is the curvilinear pattern, in which the innovation peaks in the 'interior' groups (the working class or lower middle class), and falls off at either extreme. These interior groups are the innovators, and in Labov's view they have a positive social motivation to innovate, which is group solidarity or 'local identity.' As a sociosymbolic device, a marker of belonging to their locality, their community, perhaps their class, emerging distinctive characteristics of their local dialect are favorably evaluated and adopted and extended by these groups...the interior groups lead because they are the ones for whom this local solidarity is strongest. The lowest class (the chronically unemployed, the homeless, etc.) have little or no local ties or group allegiance, and the highest classes do not depend on locality or group for their identity, but move in national or international circles.''","guy1988"

The motivation for this linguistic conservatism is the same as for political conservatism: a favorable position in the existing status quo. In other words, linguistic change should correlate directly with position in the class hierarchy, generally beginning at the bottom and being adopted only late, or never, at the top.''","guy1988"
