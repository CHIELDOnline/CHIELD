"familiarity",">","lexical decision","","","","","","reaction time may have been quicker for words with several definitions because they were more familiar to the subjects","millis1989effect"
"polysemy",">","lexical decision","","","","","","Three metrics were used to represent the meanings that subjects actually access from memory (accessible polysemy): (1) the first meanings subjects think of when asked to define stimulus words, (2) all the meanings subjects generate for words, and (3) the average number of meanings subjects generate. The results showed that the second and third metrics of polysemy influenced lexical decision time, whereas the first metric (representing mostly the access to dominant meanings for words) only approached significance.","millis1989effect"
