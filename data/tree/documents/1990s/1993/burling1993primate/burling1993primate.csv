"gesture-call system","/>","human language","none","","coevolution","hypothesis","none","That human language emerged as an elaboration or  evolutionary outgrowth of our own gesture-call system  seems implausible. If it did not emerge from our own  gesture-call system, its emergence from some other ges ture-call system is no more plausible. [And then later elaborated throughout the section "" Alarms, Grunts, Words, and Smiles"".]","burling1993primate"
"throwing","^","human language","pos","","coevolution","review","none"," Among recent work that  has focused on the mind and brain is Calvin's (I983,  I987) suggestion that the adaptations of the nervous sys tem that made accurate throwing possible could have  contributed to language ability","burling1993primate"
"foraging strategy","^","human language","pos","","coevolution","review","none"," Wallace (1989) has proposed that the cognitive maps useful to early-hominid  foragers would have had analogues to language functions and could have played a role in fostering language abilities","burling1993primate"
"cognition","<=>","human language","pos","","coevolution","hypothesis","none","Surely the  human mind has been more profoundly altered from its  mammalian or primate antecedents than has the ges ture-call system, and it seems entirely reasonable to re gard language as the most important new component of  the mind. It is language, more than anything else, that  makes our minds different.","burling1993primate"
