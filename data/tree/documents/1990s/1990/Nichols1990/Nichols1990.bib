The oft-noted genetic and typological diversity of the languages of the New
World is due not to accidents of history but to the operation of regular
principles of linguistic geography. Four building blocks of a theory of
linguistic diversity are presented here: a classification and measures of
diversity, an account of the causes of diversity, measures of rates of
differentiation, and means of estimating the age of a linguistic population. On
the most conservative archeological view, the New World was first colonized
some 12,000 years ago; on the received view, up to 20,000 years ago. But no
high-latitude area like Siberia, Beringia, Alaska, or northern Canada could
have contributed or transmitted the linguistic diversity to seed the New World
in these time frames, and no single dispersing family could have given rise to
the attested diversity in these time frames. The unmis- takable testimony of
the linguistic evidence is that the New World has been inhabited nearly as long
as Australia or New Guinea, perhaps some 35,000 years. Genetic unity for
'Amerind' is incompatible with the chronology demanded by the linguistic facts.}
