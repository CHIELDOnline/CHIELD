"latitude",">","linguistic diversity","neg",NA,"language change","hypothesis","no","Other things being equal, density of lineages is substantially greater at low latitudes than at high latitudes.","Nichols1990"
"coastline",">","linguistic diversity","pos",NA,"language change","hypothesis","no","Other things being equal, the coastal area of a continent will generally have substantially greater lineage density than the interior","Nichols1990"
"climate:rainfall",">","linguistic diversity","pos",NA,"language change","hypothesis","no","Where coastline is dry, density of lineages can be low even at relatively low latitudes, as in western Australia and western South America. Thus rainfall and/or availability of water in general may be a separate factor, although here it will often be lumped with the coast/interior distinction","Nichols1990"
"physical terrain: roughness",">","linguistic diversity","pos",NA,"language change","hypothesis","no","Mountains ... The cause of high lineage density in mountain areas is generally attributed to the fact that mountainous geography naturally isolates populations, resists large-scale economic integration, and creates refuge zones.","Nichols1990"
"size of economy",">","linguistic diversity","neg",NA,"language change","hypothesis","no","SCALE OF ECONOMY. By this term is meant not so much the magnitude of production and/or extraction (although that too is relevant), but the natural territorial scope of the economy: a large-scale economy (e.g. one based on mounted nomadic stockbreeding, urban trade centers, or industrialization) in herently spreads out over a substantial territory ... Density of lineages is low in areas dominated by large-scale economies, higher in areas with smaller-scale economies.","Nichols1990"
