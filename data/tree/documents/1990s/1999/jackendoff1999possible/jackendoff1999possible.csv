"simple syntax",">>","protolanguage","","","preadaptation","hypothesis","","""To go beyond single symbols toward modern language, we need two major innovations. The first is to permit an un limitedly large class of symbols in the system (a large lexi con); the second is the concatenation of symbols into larger utterances (the beginning of syntax). These two are logically independent: one could have a communicative system involving only one or the other.""","jackendoff1999possible"

"metasymbolic capability",">>","large lexicon","none","","preadaptation","hypothesis","","""Hominids had to be adapted to be able occasionally to invent new symbols. It is not clear tome how much metasymbolic capability this would require; the issue requires more investigation.""","jackendoff1999possible"
"large lexicon",">","vocal tract","","","coevolution","hypothesis","","""The evolution of the vocal tract can be seen as driven by the adaptivity of a larger vocabulary, through more rapid articulation and enhanced comprehensibility.""","jackendoff1999possible"
"linear word order","~","semantic roles","","","coevolution","hypothesis","","""Crucially, these principles correlate linear order with semantic roles. They do not re quire syntactic structure: the linear order of words can be de termined directly in terms of phonological concatenation.""","jackendoff1999possible"

"imitation",">>","large lexicon","pos","","preadaptation","hypothesis","","""At some point, then, the hominid line had to adapt to learning this vast number of symbols. As Donald has stressed, the uniquely human ability to imitate obviously plays a role here. ""","jackendoff1999possible"
"language",">","thought","pos","","coevolution","hypothesis","","""Relational vocabulary plays an important role in thought. It has been argued9,40 that language enhances thoughts by making them available as perceptual objects (namely sentences), so that they can be attended to, focused on, modified, and remembered.""","jackendoff1999possible"
"syntax",">","semantic relations","","","coevolution","hypothesis","","""Similarly, phrasal syntax and inflection both help make explicit the semantic relationships among components in an utterance.(…) Under this conception, the two systems of grammar are built independently on top of the system of protolanguage, each refining communication through its own expressive techniques. I see no immediate argument for the temporal priority of one over the other in the course of evolution.”","jackendoff1999possible"
