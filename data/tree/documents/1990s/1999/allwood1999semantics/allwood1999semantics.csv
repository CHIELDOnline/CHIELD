"semantic epistemic operations",">","categories","","Cognitive semantics","cultural evolution","hypothesis","","six categories which have turned out to be useful in conceptual-semantic analysis of many languages. They have also often been pointed out by philosophers engaged in conceptual analysis, cf. Aristotle (1938), Kant (1975), Husserl (1913), Barwise and Perry (1983).","allwood1999semantics"
