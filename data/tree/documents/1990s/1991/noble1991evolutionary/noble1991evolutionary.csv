"language","~","propositional knowledge",NA,"","","",NA,"""In our definition, 'language' is the symbolic use of communicative signs; the use of signs in communicative settings  to engage in acts of reference. Such acts establish the reflective capacity of humans - their capacity for propositional knowledge about their circumstances""","noble1991evolutionary"
"language",">","hunting",NA,"","cultural evolution","hypothesis",NA,"""once it emerged, language transformed humans. For example, language is important in hunting""","noble1991evolutionary"
"language",">>","aesthetics",NA,"Aesthetics","cultural evolution","hypothesis",NA,"""Nor can there be aesthetics in hominids (Chase  & Dibble 1987: 280-3), where this is taken to refer to 'artistry' or 'taste', unless the hominids had language, since aesthetics so conceived is purely constituted by the cultural values that language alone can define""","noble1991evolutionary"
"neural structures",">>","language",NA,"","preadaptation","hypothesis",NA,"""In seeking to show how language emerged in the evolutionary record, it is necessary to meet the same conditions of verification as in the higher primate language experiments. The structures for the reception and production of communicative utterances must have emerged""","noble1991evolutionary"

"iconicity",">","symbolism",NA,"","cultural evolution","hypothesis",NA,"""the only way in which arbitrary signs could convey meanings to hominids without language is if the signs  were initially iconic, such that the form of the sign resembled the signified object""","noble1991evolutionary"

"symbolism",">","language",NA,"","cultural evolution","hypothesis",NA,"""Using symbolic behaviour as a criterion for the identification of language and culture has the advantage, once we have dismissed claims for early stone tools as symbols or as entailing symbols, that we can still define it in a way that permits its recognition through archaeological evidence. In this way, the search for the  emergence of real symbols actually does become a search for the origins of language""","noble1991evolutionary"
