"9","ecological risk",">","number of productive households","pos","ecology; demography",NA,"hypothesis","","increasing the number of productive households in a social network decreases the variation experienced by all of them as a simple consequence of the law of large numbers. This is true as long as there is some degree of statistical independence between them. This numerical averaging leads to the prediction that the number of individuals in a language group should increase as the degree of ecological risk increases","nettle1998explaining"
