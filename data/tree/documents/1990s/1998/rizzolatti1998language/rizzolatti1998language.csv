"mirror neurons",">","action: recognition and production","pos","language evolution","preadaptation","review","none","Mirror neurons activate during both the observation of the other person’s specific action (like grasping) and when a person themselves performs a given action (pp. 188-189).","rizzolatti1998language"
"action: recognition and production",">>","intentional communication","pos","language evolution","coevolution","hypothesis","none","“[…] the transition from the australopithecines to the first forms of ‘Homo’ coincided with the transition from a mirror system, enlarged, but used only for action recognition, to a human-like mirror system used for intentional communication.” (p. 193)","rizzolatti1998language"

"protolanguage: gestural",">>","speech","pos","language evolution","coevolution","hypothesis","none","“Manual gestures progressively lost their importance, whereas, by contrast, vocalization acquired autonomy, until the relation between gestural and vocal communication inverted and gesture became purely an accessory factor to sound communication. At this point speech took off.” (p. 193)","rizzolatti1998language"
