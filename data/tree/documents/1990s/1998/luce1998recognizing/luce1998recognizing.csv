"lexicon: frequency of use",">","lexical activation","pos","","language change","experiment","","The basic postulate of the model is that the process of word identification involves discriminating among lexical items in memory that are activated on the basis of stimulus input. ...  The present model attempts to specify those factors responsible for the relative ease or difficulty of recognizing words arising from the processes involved in discrimination among sound patterns of words. Thus, a second fundamental principle of the model is that discrimination is a function of the number and nature of lexical items activated by the stimulus input. The �nature� of lexical items refers specifically to the acoustic-phonetic similarity among the activated lexical items as well as their frequencies of occurrence. ...  Word frequency is important in the model only as a factor affecting the structural relationships among lexical items.","luce1998recognizing"

A diagram of a single decision unit is shown in Figure 2. Only those acoustic-phonetic patterns corresponding to words in memory will activate a word decision unit. ","luce1998recognizing"
