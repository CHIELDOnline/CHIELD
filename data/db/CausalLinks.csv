Instead, it was the result of a two-stage development. The first stage in- volved ancestral hominids borrowing simple available biomechanical properties of the sys- tem-the frame, together with static, nonresting tongue configurations-by means of classic Darwinian descent with modification, to give the three CV co-occurrence patterns. Then, an initial increase in intersyllabic serial complexity was achieved by means of the LC pattern, as a result of a self-organizational interaction of bi- omechanics, movement initiation constraints, and culturally mediated cognition (46-48)."

Kuki-Chin language Lai, however, has developed new morphological markers on the verb, which do not exist in Boro-Garo languages but also not in proto-Tibeto-Burman. Socio-historically Boro-Garo languages are “valley-languages” which are relatively large and have been under heavy language, while Kuki-Chin languages are “hill-languages”, spoken by smaller communities in more isolated locations."

Adults learning a foreign language often lack the breadth of exposure to the target language that a native speaker would have. Thus, they only partially learn the range of inflectional variants of a word, and omit morphological markers in their language production (Papadopoulou et al., 2011; Haznedar, 2006; Gurel, 2000). If non-native speakers represent a considerable part of the overall speaker population, they might drive the language towards morphological simplification."

Human language constitutes a uniquely cheap and flexible signalling device, allowing humans to engage in ‘cheap talk’ in an unprecedented range of circumstances. However, if words are easy and cost-free to produce, why should anyone believe what others say, and what is the incentive to learn thousands of words if one cannot be confident that any convey an accurate message? This constraint implies that researchers should favor theories that propose a context for the evolution of early language in which there was either no conflict of interest between the signaller and receiver, or one in which the reliability of the signals could easily be assessed (Szamado & Szathmary, 2006).

Other cooperative contexts, for instance, reliant on reciprocity, trade and group selection, could certainly have exploited a pre-existing linguistic capability, generating selection for enhanced linguistic skills. Such selective feedback would likely have made a big difference both to the scale of human cooperation that ensued, and to the potency of human language (Pagel, 2012), plausibly helping to explain how early language extended into domains in which honesty could not be assumed, and vigilance against malevolence or incompetence was required."

Gossip is rich in social information and might create transparency by revealing reputation information about others. It has been shown that prosocially oriented people use reputation gossip concerning the wrongdoings of others to warn about potential free-riders (Feinberg et al., 2012). Therefore, we hypothesize that celebrity gossip will increase trust of prosocial individuals (H1). Conversely, proselfs do not seek trust signals but situations with ambiguous social information that offer more opportunities to exploit others (Boone et al., 2010). Therefore, we hypothesize that celebrity gossip will decrease trust of proself individuals (H2). "
