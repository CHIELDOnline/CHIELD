  abstract = {Time underlies many interesting human behaviors. Thus, the question of how to represent time in connectionist models is very important. One approach is to represent time implicitly by its effects on processing rather than explicitly (as in a spatial representation). The current report develops a proposal along these lines first described by Jordan (1986) which involves the use of recurrent links in order to provide networks with a dynamic memory. In this approach, hidden unit patterns are fed back to themselves; the internal representations which develop thus reflect task demands in the context of prior internal states. A set of simulations is reported which range from relatively simple problems (temporal version of XOR) to discovering syntactic/semantic features for words. The networks are able to learn interesting internal representations which incorporate task demands with memory demands; indeed, in this approach the notion of memory is inextricably bound up with task processing. These representations reveal a rich structure, which allows them to be highly context-dependent while also expressing generalizations across classes of items. These representations suggest a method for representing lexical categories and the type/token distinction.},

Four building blocks of a theory of linguistic diversity are presented here: a classification and measures of diversity, an account of the causes of diversity, measures of rates of differentiation, and means of estimating the age of a linguistic population. On the most conservative archeological view, the New World was first colonized some 12,000 years ago; on the received view, up to 20,000 years ago. But no high-latitude area like Siberia, Beringia, Alaska, or northern Canada could have contributed or transmitted the linguistic diversity to seed the New World in these time frames, and no single dispersing family could have given rise to the attested diversity in these time frames. The unmistakable testimony of the linguistic evidence is that the New World has been inhabited nearly as long as Australia or New Guinea, perhaps some 35,000 years. Genetic unity for 'Amerind' is incompatible with the chronology demanded by the linguistic facts.},

  abstract = {Recurrent neural networks can be trained to recognize strings generated by context-free grammars, but the ability of the networks to do so depends on their having an appropriate set of initial connection weights. Simulations of evolution were performed on populations of simple recurrent networks where the selection criterion was the ability of the networks to recognize strings generated by grammars. The networks evolved sets of initial weights from which they could reliably learn to recognize the strings. In order to recognize if a string was generated by a given context-free grammar, it is necessary to use a stack or counter to keep track of the depth of embedding in the string. The networks that evolved in our simulations are able to use the values passed along their recurrent connections for this purpose. Furthermore, populations of networks can evolve a bias towards learning the underlying regularities in a class of related languages. These results suggest a new explanation for the ``critical period'' effects observed in the acquisition of language and other cognitive faculties. Instead of being the result of an exogenous maturational process, the degraded acquisition ability may be the result of the values of innately specified initial weights diverging in response to training on spurious input.},

The number of different species found in a given area of the Earth increases from the poles towards the equator for a wide range of terrestrial and marine organisms. A similar but opposite latitudinal gradient is also generally found in the size of the geographic range over which a species is found: range sizes are larger in more northern latitudes becoming smaller in the south, a phenomenon known as Rapaport’s rule. Here we show that the density of human language-cultural groups in North America, at the time of contact by colonizing Europeans, also followed a strong latitudinal gradient qualitatively similar to that found in North American mammals. Six times, or more, different languages were spoken in a given area in southern latitudes, compared to the density of language groups nearer to the poles. In addition, the amount of territory over which the speakers of a given language were found increases with latitude: linguistic-cultural groups conform to Rapaport’s rule. Finally, based upon a categorization of North America into 23 distinct major habitat types, we find greater linguistic diversity in areas of greater habitat diversity, independently of latitude. ‘Linguistic ecology’, or the examination of ecological factors associated with diversity in the number of linguistic groups, may shed new light on some features of cultural and linguistic evolution.

  abstract = {<P> One hypothesis for the evolution of hominid bipedalism is that bipedalism was more efficient than quadrupedalism for long-distance terrestrial locomotion, and was favored when resources became scarcer and more widely separated during the drying of African forests in the Miocene. Here we extend this scenario for the evolution of bipedalism based on principles of behavioral ecology of extant primates. Daily travel distance is not only an increasing function of resource scarcity, but also of group size (because of intragroup scramble competition). When faced with Miocene drying, hominoids were forced to evolve either energetically more efficient locomotory abilities or smaller group sizes. The cost of the latter strategy is that smaller groups are less successful than larger groups in intergroup contest competition (smaller groups are supplanted from limiting resources). Among the earliest hominids, bipedalism may have been favored over small group size as an alternative energetic response to decreased resource availability. The alternative was to maintain quadrupedal locomotion but evolve fission-fusion grouping to reduce daily travel distance for individuals and hence, their energetic costs of travel. We suggest that this strategy represents the evolutionary pathway taken by chimpanzees. This divergence of strategies may have been a result of inherent differences in feeding ecology, but could also have been enhanced by the pre-empting of niche space by the two closely related and presumably competing hominoid ancestors of humans and chimpanzees. If so, it could have been a potential factor in the speciation process that led to modern humans and chimpanzees.</P>},

  abstract = {The research described in this thesis tries to explain the origins and the struc- ture of human sound systems (and more specifically human vowel systems) as the result of self-organisation in a population under functional con- straints. These constraints are: acoustic distinctiveness, articulatory ease and ease of learning. The process is modelled with computer simulations, following the meth- odology of artificial life and artificial intelligence. The research is part of a larger re- search effort into understanding the origins and the nature of language and intelli- gence. <p> The emergence of sound systems is studied in a setting called the imitation game. In an imitation game, agents from a population interact in order to imitate each other as well as possible. Imitation is a binary process: it is either successful or a failure. Agents are able to produce and perceive speech sounds in a human-like way, and to adapt and extend their repertoires of speech sounds in reaction to the outcome of the imitation games. The agents' vowel repertoires are initially empty and are bootstrapped by random insertion of a speech sound when an agent with an empty repertoire wants to produce a sound. When the agents' repertoires are not empty anymore, random insertion does not happen anymore, except with very low probability. This low-probability random insertion is done in order to keep a pres- sure on the agents to extend their number of vowels. . <p> As the agents' repertoires are initially empty and their production and percep- tion are not biased towards any language in particular, the systems of speech sounds that emerge are language-independent and can be considered predictions of the kinds of systems of speech sounds that can be found in human languages. <p> The main focus of the thesis is on the emergence of vowel systems. It is shown that coherent, successful and realistic vowel systems emerge for a wide range of pa- rameter settings in the simulation. When the vowel systems are compared with the types of vowel systems that are found in human languages, remarkable similarities are found. Not only are the most frequently found human vowel systems predicted, (this could already be done with direct optimisation of acoustic distinctiveness) but also less frequently occurring vowel systems are predicted in approximately the right proportions. <p> Variations on the basic imitation game show that it is remarkably robust. Not only do coherent, successful and realistic vowel systems emerge for a large number of parameter settings, but they also emerge when either the imitation game or the agents are changed qualitatively. Coherent and realistic systems still emerge when the perception and production of the agents are changed. Even if the rules of the imitation game are slightly changed, coherent and realistic systems still emerge. Of course, there are circumstances under which no systems emerge, indicating that the process is non-trivial. <p> It is also shown that the vowel systems can emerge and be preserved in chang- ing populations. When old agents are removed from the population, and new, empty agents are added, coherent and realistic vowel systems can still emerge, provided that the replacement rate is not too high. It is also shown in the thesis that vowel systems can be preserved in a population, even though all original agents in it have been replaced. Furthermore, it is shown that under certain circumstances it can be advantegeous to have an age-structure in the population, so that older agents learn less quickly than young ones. <p> Finally, some experiments with more complex utterances are presented in the thesis. An experiment with artificial CV-syllables is presented and it is shown that, although phonemically coded (as opposed to holistically coded) systems can emerge, this simulation is much harder and much more sensitive to parameter changes than the vowel simulation. This probably has to do with the fact that in the case of CV- syllables multiple independent and partly contradictory constraints have to be satis- fied simultaneously, whereas in the vowel simulations, only one constraint (acoustic distinctiveness) is really important. Also, the first attempts at building a system that can produce complex and dynamic utterances without any constraints on their structure are presented, and it is argued that the main obstacle to getting such a system to work is the mapping from acoustic signals back to articulatory com- mands. <p> The conclusion of the thesis is that universal tendencies of human vowel sys- tems, and probably of human sound systems in general can be explained as the re- sult of self-organisation in a population of agents that try to communicate as well as possible under articulatory and acoustic constraints. The articulatory and acoustic constraints cause the emerging sound systems to tend towards articulatory and acoustic optimality. However, the fact that the agents communicate in a population forces them to conform to the sound system in the population and causes sub- optimal systems to emerge as well.},

  abstract = {An exploration is presented of the interplay between the situated activity of embodied autonomous organisms and the social dynamics they constitute in interaction, with special emphasis on evolutionary, ecological and behavioral aspects. The thesis offers a series of theoretical and methodological criticisms of recent investigations on the biology of social behavior and animal communication. An alternative theoretical framework, based on a systemic theory of biological autonomy, is provided to meet these criticisms and the elaboration of the corresponding theoretical arguments is supported by the construction and analysis of mathematical and computational models. <p> A game of action coordination is studied by a series of game-theoretic, ecological and computational models which, by means of systematic comparisons, permit the identification of the evolutionary relevance of different factors like finite populations, ecological and genetic constraints, spatial patterns, discreteness and stochasticity. Only in an individual-based model is it found that cooperative action coordination is evolutionarily stable. This is due to the emergence of spatial clusters in the spatial distribution of players which break many of the in-built symmetries of the game and act as invariants of the dynamics constraining the path of viable evolution. <p> An extension to this model explores other structuring effects by adding the possibility of parental influences on phenotypic development. The result is a further stabilization of cooperative coordination which is explained by the presence of self-promoting networks of developmental relationships which enslave the evolutionary dynamics. <p> The behavioral aspects involved in the attainment of a coordinated state between autonomous systems are studied in a simulated model of embodied agents coupled through an acoustic medium. Agents must locate and approach each other only by means of continuous acoustic signals. The results show the emergence of synchronized rhythmic signalling patterns that resemble turn-taking which is accompanied by coherent patterns of movement. It is demonstrated that coordination results from the achievement of structural congruence between the agents during interaction.},

Then, a simple computational model is constructed for a resource-searching problem by using the multi-agent modeling method. We investigate both direct misperception, that are caused when obtaining information directly from surrounding environment, and indirect misperception, that are caused when obtaining information indirectly through communication by conducting simulation experiments. The experimental results have shown that misperception could increase diversity in behavior of agents, thus could be adaptive, while accurate communication could decrease a diversity of agent behavior, which might decrease fitness. This paper also discusses a correlative relationship between direct misperception and indirect misperception.

  abstract = {This thesis proposes a framework adopting the self-organization theory for the study of language evolution. Self-organization explains collective behaviors and evolution with the observation that the patterns at the global level in a complex system are often properties spontaneously emergent from the numerous local interactions among the individual components, and they cannot be understood by only examining the individual components. <p> Language can be viewed as such emergent properties instead of products from some innate blueprint in humans. We highlight the importance of recognizing language at two distinctive but inter-dependent levels of existence, i.e. in the idiolect and in the communal language, and a self-organizing process existing at each of the two levels. It is necessary to clarify what phenomena are properties of the idiolects, and what properties are the collective behaviors at the population level. <p> In linguistics, however, very often an abstract language system is taken as the object of analysis. This level of analysis disregards the distinction between idiolect and communal language, and neglects the heterogeneous nature of language at both levels. As a consequence, explanations for observed patterns based on this abstract level of analysis are often inadequate. However, this is a necessary step for linguists to identify interesting phenomena in the first place. At this abstract level of analysis, the self-organization framework can also be applied. It is assumed that the abstract language system self-organizes. A study on homophony in languages is taken as an example to illustrate the analysis at this level. It is shown that the existence of homophony reflects several self-organization characteristics in a dynamic process of language evolution, such as the predictable degree of homophony, the disyllabification in Chinese dialects, the differentiation of homophone pairs in grammatical class. <p> We are further interested in how the self-organization is implemented. To answer this question, we need to look into the idiolects in this self-organizing process, to know how the idiolects are formed and affect each other. Language change provides an informative window in addressing these issues. Language change is the result of the collective behaviors of idiolects, even as it affects the idiolects. The heterogeneity among idiolects is exposed to the greatest extent in on-going changes. <p> An on-going sound change in Cantonese is taken as a case study to scrutinize the heterogeneity in the self-organizing processes. The fieldwork data reveal a large degree of variation both in the population (VT-I) and in the set of words (VT-II). Another type of variation (VT-III) is highlighted, that is, a word may also show variation within one single speaker. But this VT-III within speakers only exists in a proportion, but not all, of the words subject to the change. Also we find that if a speaker has some words consistently in the unchanged state and some words in the changed state, then this speaker must have some other words in the variation state. Most speakers show the existence of VT-III, but they vary in degree. The observed individual differences in the degree of VT-III suggest that the large heterogeneity may be not only accounted for by the variability of linguistic input, but also by individuals' different learning styles. We hypothesize two types of lexical learning styles, i.e. probabilistic and categorical learning. These differences in learning styles suggest that when we examine the agent's internal properties in the self-organization framework, it is not only necessary to examine the commonalities among agents, but also the differences among them. <p> In addition to empirical studies, this thesis employs computational modeling as a major tool for investigation, as modeling provides effective ways to test hypotheses beyond empirical studies, and suggests new questions. After a brief review of the modeling studies in the field, some models developed in this thesis for language origin and language change are reported. <p> The first model is to simulate the emergence of a consistent vocabulary from a set of random mappings between meanings and forms. It emphasizes the importance of implementing the actual process of interaction among agents, and the cumulative effect on agents' linguistic behaviors. The model suggests that the Saussurean sign with identical speaking and listening mappings may not be a biological predisposition from natural selection, but rather a result from the process of language learning and use. The process exhibits a phase transition from a long period of small oscillation to an abrupt convergence. Such phase transition is often observed in self-organizing systems. <p> The second model simulates language change as innovation diffusion, and examines the effects of various factors, including some concerning properties of agents and some affecting agents' interactions. By comparing the outcome under different conditions, the model illustrates the importance of incorporating realistic assumptions, such as finite population size, age-dependent propensity to change, different learning environment in a social network, etc. The model compares the dynamics of language change in different types of network structures and shows that in non-regular networks, the rate of innovation diffusion increases little as population size increases. The model also tests the effect of the two types of hypothesized learning styles, and shows that in a population with the presence of probabilistic learners, an innovation with a small advantage will easily spread into the population and lead to a change. This may explain why language changes are so frequent. <p> This thesis demonstrates that both empirical and modeling studies on language evolution can greatly benefit from adopting a self-organization framework. The convergence and interplay of the two lines of exploration, i.e. biological bases in agents and the long term effect of interactions among them, should bring us a deeper understanding of how language has evolved and is evolving.},

  abstract = {It has been observed that borrowing within a group of genetically related languages often causes the lexical similarities among them to be skewed. Consequently, it has been proposed that borrowing can sometimes be inferred from such skewing. However, heterogeneity in the rate of lexical replacement, as well as borrowing from other languages, can also give rise to skewed lexical similarities. It is important, therefore, to determine to what degree skewing is a statistically significant indicator of borrowing. Here, we describe a statistical hypothesis test for detecting language contact based on skewing of linguistic characters of arbitrary type. Significant probabilities of correct detection of contact are maintained for various contact scenarios, with low false alarm probability. Our experiments show that the test is fairly robust to substantial heterogeneity in the retention rate, both across characters and across lineages, suggesting that the method can provide an objective criterion against which claims of significant skewing due to contact can be tested, pointing the way for more detailed analysis.},

We present an extensive study of its dynamics on complex networks, that can be considered as the most natural topological embedding for agents involved in language games and opinion dynamics. Except for some community structured networks on which metastable phases can be observed, agents playing the Naming Game always manage to reach a global consensus. This convergence is obtained after a time generically scaling with the population's size $N$ as $t\_{conv} \sim N^{1.4 \pm 0.1}$, i.e. much faster than for agents embedded on regular lattices. Moreover, the memory capacity required by the system scales only linearly with its size. Particular attention is given to heterogenous networks, in which the dynamical activity pattern of a node depends on its degree. High degree nodes have a fundamental role, but require larger memory capacity. They govern the dynamics acting as spreaders of (linguistic) conventions. The effects of other properties, such as the average degree and the clustering, are also discussed.},

On the contrary, in the Naming Game, a recently proposed model of Language formation, each agent chooses a particular state, or opinion, by means of a memory-based negotiation process, during which a variable number of states is collected and kept in memory. In this perspective, the statistical features of the number of states collected by the agents becomes a relevant quantity to understand the dynamics of the model, and the influence of topological properties on memory-based models. By means of a master equation approach, we analyze the internal agent dynamics of Naming Game in populations embedded on networks, finding that it strongly depends on very general topological properties of the system (e.g. average and fluctuations of the degree). However, the influence of topological properties on the microscopic individual dynamics is a general phenomenon that should characterize all those social interactions that can be modeled by memory-based negotiation processes.},

The assumption underlying such ideas is that verbal transmission of information provides unalloyed benefits, by reducing the costs of learning about the environment. However, this raises the question of why no other species has discovered such a good trick. I argue that verbal transmission is only likely to be adaptive in a restricted range of circumstances. Even then, it cannot be exclusively relied on, and it causes problems of deceit and instances of maladaptation. We should expect natural selection to have made us discriminating evaluators of verbal information who ultimately trust the evidence of our senses.

The underlying theory is that people in warmer climates communicate at a distance more often than people in colder climates, and it is adaptive to use syllables and sounds that are more easily heard and recognized at a distance. However, there is considerable variability in warm as opposed to cold climates, which needs to be explained. In the present research report, we show that additional factors increase the predictability of sonority. We find that more specific features of the environment-such as type of plant cover and degree of mountainous terrain-help to predict sonority. And, consistent with previous research on folk-song style, measures of sexual restrictiveness also predict low sonority.},

To evaluate this population fissions mechanism, we collected published mtDNA sequences for 1,381 individuals from 17 Native Central and South American populations. We then tested the hypothesis that three well-known language classifications also represented the genetic structure of these populations. We rejected the hypothesis for each language classification. Our tests revealed linguistic and genetic correspondence in several shallow branches common to each classification, but no linguistic and genetic correspondence in the deeper branches contained in two of the language classifications. We discuss the possible causes for the lack of congruence between linguistic and genetic structure in the region, and describe alternative mechanisms of linguistic and genetic correspondence and their predictions.},

No general linguistic mechanism has been advanced to explain this striking variation in rates of lexical replacement among meanings. Here we use four large and divergent language corpora (English, Spanish, Russian and Greek) and a comparative database of 200 fundamental vocabulary meanings in 87 Indo-European languages to show that the frequency with which these words are used in modern language predicts their rate of replacement over thousands of years of Indo-European language evolution. Across all 200 meanings, frequently used words evolve at slower rates and infrequently used words evolve more rapidly. This relationship holds separately and identically across parts of speech for each of the four language corpora, and accounts for approximately 50\% of the variation in historical rates of lexical replacement. We propose that the frequency with which specific words are used in everyday language exerts a general and law-like influence on their rates of evolution. Our findings are consistent with social models of word change that emphasize the role of selection, and suggest that owing to the ways that humans use language, some words will evolve slowly and others rapidly across all languages.},

The experiment involved pairwise computerized communication between 152 subjects involved in at least 60 rounds. The subjects had to develop a common code referring to items in varying lists of geometrical figures distinguished by up to three features. A code had to be made of a limited repertoire of letters. Using letters had a cost. We are interested in the question of whether a common code is developed, and what enhances its emergence. Furthermore, we explore the emergence of compositional, protogrammatical structure in such codes. We compare environments that differ in terms of available linguistic resources (number of letters available) and in terms of stability of the task environment (variability in the set of figures). Our experiments show that a too small repertoire of letters causes coordination failures. Cost efficiency and role asymmetry are important factors enhancing communicative success. In stable environments, grammars do not seem to matter much, and instead efficient arbitrary codes often do better. However, in an environment with novelty, compositional grammars offer considerable coordination advantages and therefore are more likely to arise.},

This paper describes an experimental study in which participants played an anonymous economic game using an instant-messenger-style program and an artificial ‘alien language’. The competitiveness of the game and the frequency with which players interacted were manipulated. Given frequent enough interaction with team-mates, players were able to use linguistic cues to identify themselves. In the most competitive condition, this led to divergence in the language, which did not occur in other conditions. This suggests that both frequency of interaction and a pressure to use language to mark identity play a significant role in encouraging linguistic divergence over short periods, but that neither is sufficient on its own.},

Recent studies have shown that there are relationships between these types of grammatical complexity and the number of speakers a language has. Languages spoken by large populations have been found to have larger phonological inventories, but simpler morphology, than languages spoken by small populations. The results require further investigation, and, most importantly, the mechanism whereby the social context of learning and use affects the grammatical evolution of a language needs elucidation.},

  abstract = {In this paper, we provide quantitative evidence showing that languages spoken by many second language speakers tend to have relatively small nominal case systems or no nominal case at all. In our sample, all languages with more than 50% second language speakers had no nominal case. The negative association between the number of second language speakers and nominal case complexity generalizes to different language areas and families. As there are many studies attesting to the difficulty of acquiring morphological case in second language acquisition, this result supports the idea that languages adapt to the cognitive constraints of their speakers, as well as to the sociolinguistic niches of their speaking communities. We discuss our results with respect to sociolinguistic typology and the Linguistic Niche Hypothesis, as well as with respect to qualitative data from historical linguistics. All in all, multiple lines of evidence converge on the idea that morphosyntactic complexity is reduced by a high degree of language contact involving adult learners.},

  abstract = {The claim that Eskimo languages have words for different types of snow is well-known among the public, but has been greatly exaggerated through popularization and is therefore viewed with skepticism by many scholars of language. Despite the prominence of this claim, to our knowledge the line of reasoning behind it has not been tested broadly across languages. Here, we note that this reasoning is a special case of the more general view that language is shaped by the need for efficient communication, and we empirically test a variant of it against multiple sources of data, including library reference works, Twitter, and large digital collections of linguistic and meteorological data. Consistent with the hypothesis of efficient communication, we find that languages that use the same linguistic form for snow and ice tend to be spoken in warmer climates, and that this association appears to be mediated by lower communicative need to talk about snow and ice. Our results confirm that variation in semantic categories across languages may be traceable in part to local communicative needs. They suggest moreover that despite its awkward history, the topic of “words for snow” may play a useful role as an accessible instance of the principle that language supports efficient communication.},
