Instead, it was the result of a two-stage development. The first stage in- volved ancestral hominids borrowing simple available biomechanical properties of the sys- tem-the frame, together with static, nonresting tongue configurations-by means of classic Darwinian descent with modification, to give the three CV co-occurrence patterns. Then, an initial increase in intersyllabic serial complexity was achieved by means of the LC pattern, as a result of a self-organizational interaction of bi- omechanics, movement initiation constraints, and culturally mediated cognition (46-48).",

Adults learning a foreign language often lack the breadth of exposure to the target language that a native speaker would have. Thus, they only partially learn the range of inflectional variants of a word, and omit morphological markers in their language production (Papadopoulou et al., 2011; Haznedar, 2006; Gurel, 2000). If non-native speakers represent a considerable part of the overall speaker population, they might drive the language towards morphological simplification.",
