	Abstract = {The authors present a Bayesian framework for understanding how adults and children learn the meanings of words. The theory explains how learners can generalize meaningfully from just one or a few positive examples of a novel word's referents, by making rational inductive inferences that integrate prior knowledge about plausible word meanings with the statistical structure of the observed examples. The theory addresses shortcomings of the two best known approaches to modeling word learning, based on deductive hypothesis elimination and associative learning. Three experiments with adults and children test the Bayesian account's predictions in the context of learning words for object categories at multiple levels of a taxonomic hierarchy. Results provide strong support for the Bayesian account over competing accounts, in terms of both quantitative model fits and the ability to explain important qualitative phenomena. Several extensions of the basic theory are discussed, illustrating the broader potential for Bayesian models of word learning.},

	Abstract = {In this paper an experiment is presented in which two mobile robots develop a shared lexicon of which the meanings are grounded in the real world. The robots start without a lexicon nor shared meanings and play language games in which they generate new meanings and negotiate words for these meanings. The experiment tries to find the minimal conditions under which verbal communication may begin to evolve. The robots are autonomous in terms of computing and cognition, but they are otherwise far simpler than most, if not all animals. It is demonstrated that a lexicon nevertheless can be made to emerge even though there are strong limits on the size and stability of this lexicon},

	Abstract = {Song diversity results from the interactions between natural selection, sexual selection, and individual learning. To understand song diversity, all three factors must be considered collectively, not separately. Bengalese Finches were domesticated about 250†yr ago. Their courtship songs have become different from their ancestor, the White-rumped Munia. Bengalese Finches sing songs with complex note-to-note transition patterns and with acoustically diverse song notes while White-rumped Munias sing songs with fixed note sequence and mostly broad band song notes. Bengalese Finches were selected for domestication based on their good parenting ability, not their songs, but this artificial selection has nonetheless affected their songs. To test whether divergence occurred not only in the song phenotypes but also in the genetic basis for predisposition of strain specific song learning, we conducted a cross-fostering experiment between Bengalese Finches and White-rumped Munias. In both strains, song learning was affected by rearing condition: the acoustical feature and transition patterns followed those of the foster fathers. However, the accuracy of song learning differed between the wild and the domesticated strains: sharing of song note between sons and tutors in Finches was not very accurate regardless of the tutor, while Munias were highly accurate in copying Munia songs but often omitted song elements from Finch fathers. These results suggest that White-rumped Munias are strongly constrained to learn their own strain's song, and that this constraint was relaxed in the Bengalese Finch by domestication.},

	Abstract = {Syntactic rules allow a speaker to combine signals with existing meanings to create an infinite number of new meanings. Even though combinatory rules have also been found in some animal communication systems, they have never been clearly linked to concurrent changes in meaning. The present field experiment indicates that wild Diana monkeys, Cercopithecus diana, may comprehend the semantic changes caused by a combinatory rule present in the natural communication of another primate, the Campbell's monkey, C. campbelli. Campbell's males give acoustically distinct alarm calls to leopards, Panthera pardus, and crowned-hawk eagles, Stephanoaetus coronatus, and Diana monkeys respond to these calls with their own corresponding alarm calls. However, in less dangerous situations, Campbell's males emit a pair of low, resounding [`]boom' calls before their alarm calls. Playbacks of boom-introduced Campbell's alarm calls no longer elicited alarm calls in Diana monkeys, indicating that the booms have affected the semantic specificity of the subsequent alarm calls. When the booms preceded the alarm calls of Diana monkeys, however, they were no longer effective as semantic modifiers, indicating that they are meaningful only in conjunction with Campbell's alarm calls. I discuss the implications of these findings for the evolution of syntactic abilities.},

@article{Way_Liberman_2010,
	Abstract = {Genes and culture are often thought of as opposite ends of the nature-nurture spectrum, but here we examine possible interactions. Genetic association studies suggest that variation within the genes of central neurotransmitter systems, particularly the serotonin (5-HTTLPR, MAOA-uVNTR) and opioid (OPRM1 A118G), are associated with individual differences in social sensitivity, which reflects the degree of emotional responsivity to social events and experiences. Here, we review recent work that has demonstrated a robust cross-national correlation between the relative frequency of variants in these genes and the relative degree of individualism-collectivism in each population, suggesting that collectivism may have developed and persisted in populations with a high proportion of putative social sensitivity alleles because it was more compatible with such groups. Consistent with this notion, there was a correlation between the relative proportion of these alleles and lifetime prevalence of major depression across nations. The relationship between allele frequency and depression was partially mediated by individualism-collectivism, suggesting that reduced levels of depression in populations with a high proportion of social sensitivity alleles is due to greater collectivism. These results indicate that genetic variation may interact with ecological and social factors to influence psychocultural differences.},

@article{Baronchelli_2010,
	Abstract = {The empirical evidence that human color categorization exhibits some universal patterns beyond superficial discrepancies across different cultures is a major breakthrough in cognitive science. As observed in the World Color Survey (WCS), indeed, any two groups of individuals develop quite different categorization patterns, but some universal properties can be identified by a statistical analysis over a large number of populations. Here, we reproduce the WCS in a numerical model in which different populations develop independently their own categorization systems by playing elementary language games. We find that a simple perceptual constraint shared by all humans, namely the human Just Noticeable Difference (JND), is sufficient to trigger the emergence of universal patterns that unconstrained cultural interaction fails to produce. We test the results of our experiment against real data by performing the same statistical analysis proposed to quantify the universal tendencies shown in the WCS [Kay P & Regier T. (2003) Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. USA 100: 9085-9089], and obtain an excellent quantitative agreement. This work confirms that synthetic modeling has nowadays reached the maturity to contribute significantly to the ongoing debate in cognitive science.},

	Abstract = {In learning the meanings of words, children are guided by a set of constraints that give privilege to some potential meanings over others. These word-learning constraints are sometimes viewed as part of a specifically linguistic endowment. However, several recent computational models suggest concretely how word-learning - constraints included - might emerge from more general aspects of cognition, such as associative learning, attention and rational inference. This article reviews these models, highlighting the link between general cognitive forces and the word-learning they subserve. Ultimately, these cognitive forces might leave their mark not just on language learning, but also on language itself: in constraining the space of possible meanings, they place limits on cross-linguistic semantic variation.},

	Abstract = {How do communities establish shared communication systems? The Common Knowledge view assumes that symbolic conventions develop through the accumulation of common knowledge regarding communication practices among the members of a community. In contrast with this view, it is proposed that coordinated communication emerges a by-product of local interactions among dyads. A set of multi-agent computer simulations show that a population of "egocentric" agents can establish and maintain symbolic conventions without common knowledge. In the simulations, convergence to a single conventional system was most likely and most efficient when agents updated their behavior on the basis of local rather than global, system-level information. The massive feedback and parallelism present in the simulations gave rise to phenomena that are often assumed to result from complex strategic processing on the part of individual agents. The implications of these findings for the development of theories of language use are discussed.},

Despite the many interesting empirical results these studies have produced, most of this research lacks a formal elucidating theory. In this paper we show how a population of agents can reach linguistic consensus, i.e. learn to use one common language to communicate with one another. Our approach differs from existing formal work in two important ways: one, we relax the too strong assumption that an agent samples infinitely often during each time interval. This assumption is usually made to guarantee convergence of an empirical learning process to a deterministic dynamical system. Two, we provide a proof that under these new realistic conditions, our model converges to a common language for the entire population of agents. Finally the model is experimentally validated.},

@article{Dunn_2011,
	Abstract = {Languages vary widely but not without limit. The central goal of linguistics is to describe the diversity of human languages and explain the constraints on that diversity. Generative linguists following Chomsky have claimed that linguistic diversity must be constrained by innate parameters that are set as a child learns a language. In contrast, other linguists following Greenberg have claimed that there are statistical tendencies for co-occurrence of traits reflecting universal systems biases, rather than absolute constraints or parametric variation. Here we use computational phylogenetic methods to address the nature of constraints on linguistic diversity in an evolutionary framework. First, contrary to the generative account of parameter setting, we show that the evolution of only a few word-order features of languages are strongly correlated. Second, contrary to the Greenbergian generalizations, we show that most observed functional dependencies between traits are lineage-specific rather than universal tendencies. These findings support the view that-at least with respect to word order-cultural evolution is the primary factor that determines linguistic structure, with the current state of a linguistic system shaping and constraining future states.},

@article{Selten_Warglien_2007,
	Abstract = {We investigate in a series of laboratory experiments how costs and benefits of linguistic communication affect the emergence of simple languages in a coordination task when no common language is available in the beginning. The experiment involved pairwise computerized communication between 152 subjects involved in at least 60 rounds. The subjects had to develop a common code referring to items in varying lists of geometrical figures distinguished by up to three features. A code had to be made of a limited repertoire of letters. Using letters had a cost. We are interested in the question of whether a common code is developed, and what enhances its emergence. Furthermore, we explore the emergence of compositional, protogrammatical structure in such codes. We compare environments that differ in terms of available linguistic resources (number of letters available) and in terms of stability of the task environment (variability in the set of figures). Our experiments show that a too small repertoire of letters causes coordination failures. Cost efficiency and role asymmetry are important factors enhancing communicative success. In stable environments, grammars do not seem to matter much, and instead efficient arbitrary codes often do better. However, in an environment with novelty, compositional grammars offer considerable coordination advantages and therefore are more likely to arise.},

@article{Christiansen_Chater_2008,
	Abstract = {It is widely assumed that human learning and the structure of human languages are intimately related. This relationship is frequently suggested to derive from a language-specific biological endowment, which encodes universal, but communicatively arbitrary, principles of language structure (a Universal Grammar or UG). How might such a UG have evolved? We argue that UG could not have arisen either by biological adaptation or non-adaptationist genetic processes, resulting in a logical problem of language evolution. Specifically, as the processes of language change are much more rapid than processes of genetic change, language constitutes a "moving target" both over time and across different human populations, and, hence, cannot provide a stable environment to which language genes could have adapted. We conclude that a biologically determined UG is not evolutionarily viable. Instead, the original motivation for UG--the mesh between learners and languages--arises because language has been shaped to fit the human brain, rather than vice versa. Following Darwin, we view language itself as a complex and interdependent "organism," which evolves under selectional pressures from human learning and processing mechanisms. That is, languages themselves are shaped by severe selectional pressure from each generation of language users and learners. This suggests that apparently arbitrary aspects of linguistic structure may result from general learning and processing biases deriving from the structure of thought processes, perceptuo-motor factors, cognitive limitations, and pragmatics.},

@inproceedings{ackley94altruismIn,
	Abstract = {Computer models of evolutionary phenomena often assume that the fitness of an individual can be evaluated in isolation, but effective communication requires that individuals interact. Existing models directly reward speakers for improved behavior on the part of the listeners so that, essentially, effective communication is fitness. We present new models in which, even though 'speaking truthfully' provides no tangible benefit to the speaker, effective communication nonetheless evolves. A large population is spatially distributed so that 'communication range' approximately correlates with 'breeding range,' so that most of the time 'you'll be talking to family,' allowing kin selection to encourage the emergence of communication. However, the emergence of altruistic communication also creates niches that can be exploited by 'information parasites.' The new models display complex and subtle long-term dynamics as the global implications of such social dilemmas are played out.},

The neo-Darwinian evolutionary scheme is founded on a probability structure that satisfies the Kolmogorovian axioms, and as a consequence cannot incorporate quantum-like evolutionary change. In earlier research we revealed quantum structures in processes taking place in conceptual space. We argue that the presence of quantum structures in language and the earlier detected quantum structures in conceptual change make the neo-Darwinian evolutionary scheme strictly too limited for Evolutionary Epistemology. We sketch how we believe that evolution in a more general way should be implemented in epistemology and conceptual change, but also in biology, and how this view would lead to another relation between both biology and epistemology.},

In our approach, the assumption of autonomy plays a key role to preserve the opportunity for the agents of local encoding of meanings. We consider the application scenario of Web services, where we conceive the problem of advertisement as a matter of sharing a denotational language. We provide a precise formulation of the agentsrsquo behavior within a game-theoretical setting. As an important consequence of our ``advertising games,'' we interpret the problem of knowledge interoperability and management in the light of evolutionary dynamics and learning in games. Our methodology is inspired by work in natural language semantics and ``language games.''},

@inproceedings{akaishi03misperception,
	Abstract = {It is commonly agreed upon that misperception is detrimental. However, misperception might have a beneficial effect from a collective viewpoint when individuals mispercept incoming information that promotes a specific kind of behavior, which leads to an increase in diversity. First, this paper proposes our hypothesis regarding adaptive property of misperception based on the argument of the relationship between misperception and behavioral diversity, and the effects of communication on diversity. Then, a simple computational model is constructed for a resource-searching problem by using the multi-agent modeling method. We investigate both direct misperception, that are caused when obtaining information directly from surrounding environment, and indirect misperception, that are caused when obtaining information indirectly through communication by conducting simulation experiments. The experimental results have shown that misperception could increase diversity in behavior of agents, thus could be adaptive, while accurate communication could decrease a diversity of agent behavior, which might decrease fitness. This paper also discusses a correlative relationship between direct misperception and indirect misperception. We believe that the study on adaptive property of misperception based on an innovative frame of reference and a powerful methodology in the field of complex system or artificial life would shed light on fundamental issues in cognitive science, memetics and engineering.},

Multiagent planning generally assumes that agents share a common means of communication; however, in building robust distributed systems it is important to address potential mis-coordination resulting from misinterpretation of messages exchanged. This paper lays foundations for studying this problem, examining its properties analytically and empirically in a decision-theoretic context. Solving the problem optimally is often intractable, but our approach enables agents using different languages to converge upon coordination over time.},

@book{allott87motorTheory,
	Abstract = {The motor theory is not only a theory of language origin and development but also a theory of current language function. Language is constructed on the basis of a previously existing complex system, the neural motor system. The motor system has been built up from a limited number of primitive elements - units of motor action - which can be formed into more extended motor programs. The programs and procedures which evolved for the construction and execution of simple and sequential motor movements formed the basis of the programs and procedures going to form language. The development of the language capacity has resulted from the progressive establishment of new cross-modal or transfunctional neural linkages, cerebral reorganization in the sense that the interconnectedness of different brain regions concerned with what are usually considered distinct functions, has substantially increased. This extensive relation between language and the motor system is what one might reasonably expect, given the central role of the motor system in all behaviour and the essentially motor character of speech production, as the outcome of movements of the articulatory apparatus. The motor system is seen as the indispensable mediator between different modalities, and particularly between language and perception.},

	Abstract = {This article offers a conceptual framework for integrated analysis of subprocesses in action and language, based on goal-directed action. Anatomical substrates are discussed in the companion paper (Arbib and Bota, 2003) which approaches ``Integrative Models of Broca's Area and the Ventral Premotor Cortex'' within the context of explaining why the evolution of the human brain yielded mechanisms which support language in a multi-modal vocal-manual-facial system rather than privileging the vocal mode. Arbib and Bota (2003) examine homologies between different cortical areas in macaque and human to revisit the Mirror System Hypothesis (MSH) of Rizzolatti and Arbib (1998)--the notion that the mirror system for grasping (which has its frontal outpost in premotor area F5 of the macaque) provides the substrate for the evolution of the language-ready brain which supports parity of communication. They also offer a critique and extension based on the work of Aboitiz and Garc{\'\i}(1997; Aboitiz et al., 2006). Arbib and Bota (2003) also discussed the utility of neuroinformatics in relating information across diverse cortical atlases and evaluating degrees of homology for brain regions of interest in different species (for discussion, see Deacon, 2004; Arbib and Bota, 2004).},

@article{arbib04BBS-monkeylikeAction,
	Abstract = {The article analyzes the neural and functional grounding of language skills as well as their emergence in hominid evolution, hypothesizing stages leading from abilities known to exist in monkeys and apes and presumed to exist in our hominid ancestors right through to modern spoken and signed languages. The starting point is the observation that both premotor area F5 in monkeys and Broca's area in humans contain a 'mirror system' active for both execution and observation of manual actions, and that F5 and Broca's area are homologous brain regions. This grounded the Mirror System Hypothesis of Rizzolatti & Arbib (1998) which offers the mirror system for grasping as a key neural 'missing link' between the abilities of our non-human ancestors of 20 million years ago and modern human language, with manual gestures rather than a system for vocal communication providing the initial seed for this evolutionary process. The present article, however, goes 'beyond the mirror' to offer hypotheses on evolutionary changes within and outside the mirror systems which may have occurred to equip Homo sapiens with a language-ready brain. Crucial to the early stages of this progression is the mirror system for grasping and its extension to permit imitation. Imitation is seen as evolving via a so-called 'simple' system such as that found in chimpanzees (which allows imitation of complex 'objectoriented' sequences but only as the result of extensive practice) to a so-called 'complex' system found in humans (which allows rapid imitation even of complex sequences, under appropriate conditions) which supports pantomime. This is hypothesized to provide the substrate for the development of protosign, a combinatorially open repertoire of manual gestures, which then provides the scaffolding for the emergence of protospeech (which thus owes little to non-human vocalizations), with protosign and protospeech then developing in an expanding spiral. It is argued that these stages involve biological evolution of both brain and body. By contrast, it is argued that the progression from protosign and protospeech to languages with full-blown syntax and compositional semantics was a historical phenomenon in the development of Homo sapiens, involving few if any further biological changes.},

@article{arbib03pt,
	Abstract = {Walter's Machina speculatrix inspired the name Rana computatrix for a family of models of visuomotor coordination in the frog, which contributed to the development of computational neuroethology. We offer here an 'evolutionary' perspective on models in the same tradition for rat, monkey and human. For rat, we show how the frog-like taxon affordance model provides a basis for the spatial navigation mechanisms that involve the hippocampus and other brain regions. For monkey, we recall two models of neural mechanisms for visuomotor coordination. The first, for saccades, shows how interactions between the parietal and frontal cortex augment superior colliculus seen as the homologue of frog tectum. The second, for grasping, continues the theme of parieto-frontal interactions, linking parietal affordances to motor schemas in premotor cortex. It further emphasizes the mirror system for grasping, in which neurons are active both when the monkey executes a specific grasp and when it observes a similar grasp executed by others. The model of humanbrain mechanisms is based on the mirror-system hypothesis of the evolution of the language-ready brain, which sees the human Broca's area as an evolved extension of the mirror system for grasping.},

	Abstract = {This chapter argues that the ability to imitate is a key innovation in the evolutionary path leading to language in the human and relates this hypothesis to specific data on brain mechanisms. In this context, imitation involves more than simply observing someone else's movement and responding with movement that in its entirety is already in one's own repertoire, imitation involves 'parsing' a complex movement. What marks humans as distinct from their common ancestors with chimpanzees is that whereas the chimpanzee can imitate short novel sequences through repeated exposure, humans can acquire (longer) novel sequences in a single trial if the sequences are not too long and the components are relatively familiar. This chapter will take us through seven hypothesized stages of evolution: (1) grasping; (2) a mirror system for grasping; (3) a simple imitation system for grasping; (4) a complex imitation system for grasping; (5) a manual-based communication system; (6) speech, which I here characterize as being the open-ended production and perception of sequences of vocal gestures, without implying that these sequences constitute a language; and (7) language.},

In addition to the functional differences between the two hypotheses, problems arise because they are grounded in different cortical maps of the macaque brain.

We used vocabulary data from three of the world's major language groups -- Bantu, Indo-European, and Austronesian -- to show that 10 to 33\% of the overall vocabulary differences among these languages arose from rapid bursts of change associated with language-splitting events. Our findings identify a general tendency for increased rates of linguistic evolution in fledgling languages, perhaps arising from a linguistic founder effect or a desire to establish a distinct social identity.},

The advertising problem can be considered as the problem of finding a common language to denote the peers' capabilities and needs.

In the paper we introduce the notion of advertising game, a specific language game designed to deal with the issue of supporting the emergence of a common denotation language over a network of peers. We provide the related computational model and an experimental evaluation. A positive empirical evidence is achieved by sketching a peer-to-peer recommendation service for bookmark exchanging using real data.},

This paper proposes an innovative solution that combines lexical approaches and language games. The benefits for distributed annotation systems on the web are twofold: firstly, it will reduce the complexity of the semantic problem by moving the focus from the full-featured ontology level to the simpler lexicon level; secondly, it will avoid the drawback of a centralized third party mediator that may become a single point of failure. The main contributions of this work are concerned with (1) providing a proof of concept that language games can be an effective solution to creating and managing a distributed process of agreement on a shared lexicon, (2) describing a fully distributed service oriented architecture for language games, (3) providing empirical evidence on a real world case study in the domain of ski mountaineering.},

However, centralized review sites such as Amazon.com have one significant advantage: reviews pertaining to a single topic are collected together in one place, allowing readers to peruse a diverse range of opinions quickly. In this paper we examine how such a topic-centric view of the Blogosphere can be created. We characterise the problems in aligning similar concepts created by a set of distributed, autonomous users and describe current initiatives to solve the problem.

Although such an approach is feasible from the technological point of view, it is not effective in practice. The process of managing this agreement may present social implications that make the solution difficult to achieve. Recent trends in research propose a new approach based on advertising games where the agreement on a common language is produced at run time. Nevertheless up to now such a model has been studied only through simulations with standalone platforms. Our contribution is the design and the development of the first web services oriented architecture for advertising games. Therefore we approached all the issues typical of distributed systems neglected by the simulators like asynchronous communications, denial of services, and so on. Finally we present a real world application where the architecture has been deployed to support the advertising task using an advertising game model.},

The knowledge overhead in developing and maintaining translation protocols between distributed case bases poses a serious challenge to CBR developers. In this paper, we situate CBR as a flexible problem-solving strategy that relies on several heterogeneous knowledge containers. We introduce a technique called language games to solve the interoperability issue. Our technique has two phases. The first is an eager learning phase where case bases communicate to build a shared indexing lexicon of similar cases in the distributed network. The second is the problem-solving phase where, using the distributed index, a case base can quickly consult external case bases if the local solution is insufficient. We provide a detailed description of our approach and demonstrate its effectiveness using an evaluation on a real data set from the tourism domain.},

The time dependent rate constant for this process has the form [small lambda, Greek(t)...]. This form implies that there are opening, middle and final phases to the introduction of new words, each distinguished by a dominant rate constant, or equivalently, rate of decay. With the occasional exception of the phase transition from beginning to middle, the rate small lambda, Greek(t) decays monotonically. Thus, small lambda, Greek(t) quantifies how the penchant of humans to introduce new words declines with the progression of their narratives, written or spoken.},

We compare in particular the convergence mechanism for interacting agents embedded in a low-dimensional lattice with respect to the mean-field case. We highlight that in low-dimensions consensus is reached through a coarsening process which requires less cognitive effort of the agents, with respect to the mean-field case, but takes longer to complete. In 1-d the dynamics of the boundaries is mapped onto a truncated Markov process from which we analytically computed the diffusion coefficient. More generally we show that the convergence process requires a memory per agent scaling as N and lasts a time N^{1+2/d} in dimension d<5 (d=4 being the upper critical dimension), while in mean-field both memory and time scale as N^{3/2}, for a population of N agents. We present analytical and numerical evidences supporting this picture.},

@article{baronchelli05sharpTransitionVocabulary,
	Abstract = {What processes can explain how very large populations are able to converge on the use of a particular word or grammatical construction without global coordination? Answering this question helps to understand why new language constructs usually propagate along an S-shaped curve with a rather sudden transition towards global agreement. It also helps to analyze and design new technologies that support or orchestrate self-organizing communication systems, such as recent social tagging systems for the web. The article introduces and studies a microscopic model of communicating autonomous agents performing language games without any central control. We show that the system undergoes a disorder/order transition, going trough a sharp symmetry breaking process to reach a shared set of conventions. Before the transition, the system builds up non-trivial scale-invariant correlations, for instance in the distribution of competing synonyms, which display a Zipf-like law. These correlations make the system ready for the transition towards shared conventions, which, observed on the time-scale of collective behaviors, becomes sharper and sharper with system size. This surprising result not only explains why human language can scale up to very large populations but also suggests ways to optimize artificial semiotic dynamics.},

	Abstract = {How do communities establish shared communication systems? The Common Knowledge view assumes that symbolic conventions develop through the accumulation of common knowledge regarding communication practices among the members of a community. In contrast with this view, it is proposed that coordinated communication emerges a by-product of local interactions among dyads. A set of multi-agent computer simulations show that a population of 'egocentric' agents can establish and maintain symbolic conventions without common knowledge. In the simulations, convergence to a single conventional system was most likely and most efficient when agents updated their behavior on the basis of local rather than global, system-level information. The massive feedback and parallelism present in the simulations gave rise to phenomena that are often assumed to result from complex strategic processing on the part of individual agents. The implications of these findings for the development of theories of language use are discussed.},

@article{Bartlett05navigationToLanguage,
	Abstract = {This article suggests that the parser underlying human syntax may have originally evolved to assist navigation, a claim supported by computational simulations as well as evidence from neuroscience and psychology. We discuss two independent conjectures about the way in which navigation could have supported the emergence of this aspect of the human language faculty: firstly, by promoting the development of a parser; and secondly, by possibly providing a topic of discussion to which this parser could have been applied with minimum effort. The paper summarizes our previously published experiments and provides original results in support of the evolutionary advantages this type of communication can provide, compared with other foraging strategies. Another aspect studied in the experiments is the combination and range of environmental factors that make communication beneficial, focusing on the availability and volatility of resources. We suggest that the parser evolved for navigation might initially have been limited to handling regular languages, and describe a mechanism that may have created selective pressure for a context-free parser.},

	Abstract = {While it is of clear benefit for the members of a population to be able to make use of information made available by others, it is not as obvious that any benefit accrues to the sender of informative signals. If the sender of information receives no benefit from so doing, a good strategy would be to exploit the informative signals of others, while sending few useful signals. There is therefore a puzzle as to how coordinated signaling systems could have evolved in the absence of benefit to the information sender. These considerations are explored in a formal model of the evolution of populations of animals that possess signaling systems they inherit from their parents. In the model, an individual's reproductive fitness depends only its ability to correctly interpret the signals of others. No maximally coordinated or stable system will emerge under such conditions. However if there is a relatively small number (less than about 10) of distinct sigals to be sent, populations can reach dynamic equilibria in which a significant fraction of the signals are correctly interpreted.},

	Abstract = {Recurrent neural networks can be trained to recognize strings generated by context-free grammars, but the ability of the networks to do so depends on their having an appropriate set of initial connection weights. Simulations of evolution were performed on populations of simple recurrent networks where the selection criterion was the ability of the networks to recognize strings generated by grammars. The networks evolved sets of initial weights from which they could reliably learn to recognize the strings. In order to recognize if a string was generated by a given context-free grammar, it is necessary to use a stack or counter to keep track of the depth of embedding in the string. The networks that evolved in our simulations are able to use the values passed along their recurrent connections for this purpose. Furthermore, populations of networks can evolve a bias towards learning the underlying regularities in a class of related languages. These results suggest a new explanation for the ``critical period'' effects observed in the acquisition of language and other cognitive faculties. Instead of being the result of an exogenous maturational process, the degraded acquisition ability may be the result of the values of innately specified initial weights diverging in response to training on spurious input.},

@article{baxter06utteranceSelectionModel,
	Abstract = {We present a mathematical formulation of a theory of language change. The theory is evolutionary in nature and has close analogies with theories of population genetics. The mathematical structure we construct similarly has correspondences with the Fisher-Wright model of population genetics, but there are significant differences. The continuous time formulation of the model is expressed in terms of a Fokker-Planck equation. This equation is exactly soluble in the case of a single speaker and can be investigated analytically in the case of multiple speakers who communicate equally with all other speakers and give their utterances equal weight. Whilst the stationary properties of this system have much in common with the single-speaker case, time-dependent properties are richer. In the particular case where linguistic forms can become extinct, we find that the presence of many speakers causes a two-stage relaxation, the first being a common marginal distribution that persists for a long time as a consequence of ultimate extinction being due to rare fluctuations.},

	Abstract = {Humans perceive a continuous colour spectrum, but divide the spectrum into colour categories in order to reason and communicate about colour. There is an ongoing debate on whether these colour categories necessary for language communication are universal or culture-specific, whether these categories are genetically determined or learned, and whether there is a causal influence of language on colour category acquisition or not. The dissertation presents a number of models, each examining one of these outstanding issues. The models draw on techniques from multi-agent systems, machine learning and evolutionary programming. After considering the behaviour of each model, we conclude in favour of a cultural specificity of language categories and argue that learning under the influence of language is the most plausible explanation for their acquisition.},

The agents perceive and categorize color stimuli, and try to communicate about these perceived stim- uli. While doing so they adapt their internal representations to be more successful at conveying color meaning in future interactions. The agents have no access to global information or to the representa- tions of other agents; they only exchange word forms. The factors driving the population coherence are the shared environment and the interactions. The experiments show how agents can form a coherent lexicon of color terms and -particularly- how a coherent color categorization emerges through these linguistic interactions. The results are interpreted in the light of theories describing and explaining universal tendencies in human color categorization and color naming. At the same time, the experiments confirm aspects of the theories of Luc Steels who views language as a complex dynamic system, arising from selforganization and cultural interactions.},

Many scholars have explained this universal character as being the result of an innate representation or an innate developmental program which all humans share. We will critically assess the available evidence, which is at best controversial, and we will suggest an alternative account for the universality of color categories based on linguistic transmission constrained by universal biases. We introduce a computational model to test our hypothesis and present results. These show that indeed the cultural acquisition of color categories together with mild constraints on the perception and categorical representation result in categories that have a distribution similar to human color categories.},

@techreport{bergstrom01thePeacock,
	Abstract = {How did human language arise, and what accounts for its present structure? Over the past decade, there has been great interest -- and impressive progress -- in using evolutionary theory to address to these and related questions. In particular, a number of studies have shown that several key features of language could plausibly arise and be maintained by natural selection when individuals have coicident interests. However, these models have largely ignored a vital strategic component of the social context in which language is employed: individuals in real societies, both past and present, do not have fully coincident interests. Simultaneously, theoretical models of animal communication have confronted these strategic issues head-on, but they have largely focused on costly (Zahavian) signals. We approach this problem directly, asking the following question: Can language evolve and be maintained under common biological scenarios of non-coincident interest? Using a trio of examples -- the peacock, the sparrow, and human language -- we show that an explicit connection can be drawn between costly signalling theory as developed for the study of animal communication, and the cheap signals employed in human language. We argue that coincident interests are not a prerequisite for linguistic communication, and explore the structural features to be expected of languages employed in societies with non-coincident interests. We find that many of the results derived previously by assuming coincident interests will also be expected under less restrictive models of society.},

	Abstract = {A trait is of adaptive value if it confers a fitness advantage to its possessor. Thus adaptivness is an ahistorical identification of a trait affording some selective advantage to an agent within some particular environment. In results reported here we identify a trait within natural language discourse as having adaptive value by computing a trait/fitness covariance; the possession of the trait correlates with the replication success of the trait's possessor. We show that the trait covaries with fitness across multiple unrelated discursive groups. In our analysis the trait in question is a particular statistically derived word?n? context, that is, a word set. Variation of the word?sage is measured as the relative presence of the word set within a particular text, that is, the percentage of the text devoted to this set of words. Fitness is measured as the rate in which the text is responded to, or replicates, within an online environment. Thus we are studying the micro?volutionary dynamics of natural language discourse.},

	Abstract = {A new microevolutionary theory of complex design within language is pro- posed. Experiments were carried out that support the theory that complex functional design --- adaptive complexity --- accumulates due to the evolu- tionary algorithm at the simplest levels within human natural language. A large software system was developed which identifies and tracks evolution- ary dynamics within text discourse. With this system hundreds of examples of activity suggesting evolutionary significance were distilled from a text collection of many millions of words. <p> Research contributions include: (1) An active replicator model of micro- evolutionary dynamics within natural language, (2) methods to distill active replicators offering evidence of evolutionary processes in action and at multiple linguistic levels (lexical, lexical co-occurrence, lexico-syntac- tic, and syntactic), (3) a demonstration that language evolution and organic evolution are both examples of a single over-arching evolutionary algo- rithm, (4) a set of tools to comparatively study language over time, and (5) methods to materially improve text retrieval.},

@article{best97culturalEvolution,
	Abstract = {The use of biological models and metaphors in studies of culture has a long and checkered history. While there are many superficial similarities between biological and cultural evolution, attempts to pin down such analogies have not been wholly successful. One limiting factor may be a lack of empirical evidence that the basic assumptions of the evolutionary model are met within a cultural system. We argue that a focus on the detection and description of the units of selection is an essential first step in constructing any evolutionary model. In this paper we outline the necessary connection between units of selection and evolution, describe the properties of a unit of selection, and introduce an empirical method for the detection of putative units of selection in a model cultural system: discourse within NetNews, a discussion system on the Internet.},

He criticises the expectation that recent discoveries such as `mirror neurons' and the FOXP2 gene will provide easy answers. He emphasises the extremely interdisciplinary nature of this field, and also the importance of involvement in it by linguists, after more than a century of neglect.},

@article{blume93evolutionaryStability,
	Abstract = {This paper identifies evolutionarily stable outcomes in games in which one player has private information and the other takes a payoff-relevant action. The informed player can communicate at little cost. Outcomes satisfying a set-valued evolutionary stability condition must exist and be efficient in common-interest games. When there is a small cost associated with using each message the outcome preferred by the informed player is stable. The paper introduces a nonequilibrium, set-valued stability notion of entry resistant sets. For games with partial common interest, the no-communication outcome is never an element of an entry resistant set.},

The model avoids some traditionally criticized features of other models of the emergence of a common lexicon such as the use of only cued representations, pre-defined fixed meanings shared by all agents, explicit meaning transmission and nonverbal feedback about the outcome of a game. While each agent forms its own concepts for distances and directions, coherent lexicon emerges enabling agents to localize objects in the environment based on their spatial description. Factors necessary for language change are then investigated in an experiment where agents join/leave the community and the results are compared to those of the related model of Steels.},

The present article offers a critical appraisal of the way in which this idea is articulated in Pinker and Bloom's (1990) selectionist account of language evolution---the most sophisticated account of its kind. It is argued that this account is less than insightful since it fails to draw some of the conceptual distinctions that are central to a certain requirement for such selectionist accounts. The requirement states that language can be accorded the evolutionary status of an adaptation by natural selection if it exhibits complex adaptive design for some evolutionary significant function.},

@phdthesis{brighton03phdthesis,
	Abstract = {How did language come to have its characteristic structure? Many argue that by understanding those parts of our biological machinery relevant to language, we can explain why language is the way it is. If the hallmarks of language are simply properties of our biological machinery, elicited through the process of language acquisition, then such an explanatory route is adequate. <p> As soon as we admit the possibility that knowledge of language is learned, in the sense that language acquisition is a process involving inductive generalisations, then an explanatory inadequacy arises. Any thorough explanation of the characteristic structure of language must now explain why the input to the language acquisition process has certain properties and not others. This thesis builds on recent work that proposes that the linguistic stimulus has certain structural properties that arise as a result of linguistic evolution. Here, languages themselves adapt to fit the task of learning: they reflect an accumulated structural residue laid down by previous generations of language users. <p> Using computational models of linguistic evolution I explore the relationship be- tween language induction and generalisation based on a simplicity principle, and the linguistic evolution of compositional structures. The two main contributions of this thesis are as follows. Firstly, using a model of induction based on the minimum description length principle, I address the question of linguistic evolution resulting from a bias towards compression. Secondly, I carry out a thorough examination of the parameter space affecting the cultural transmission of language, and note that the conditions for linguistic evolution towards compositional structure correspond to (1) specific levels of semantic complexity, and (2), induction based on sparse language exposure. <p> Ultimately, the story of the evolution of language in humans must depend on an account of the genetic evolution of the biological machinery underlying language. Rather than explicitly encoding the observed constraints on language, I argue that any explanation based on biological evolution should instead aim to explain how the conditions for linguistic evolution, outlined above, came about.},

@article{brighton02compositionalSyntax,
	Abstract = {A growing body of work demonstrates that syntactic structure can evolve in populations of genetically identical agents. Traditional explanations for the emergence of syntactic structure employ an argument based on genetic evolution: syntactic structure is specified by an innate Language Acquisition Device (LAD). Knowledge of language is complex, yet the data available to the language learner is sparse. This incongruous situation, termed the ``poverty of the stimulus'', is accounted for by placing much of the specification of language in the LAD. The assumption is that the characteristic structure of language is somehow coded genetically. The effect of language evolution on the cultural substrate, in the absence of genetic change, is not addressed by this explanation. We show that the poverty of the stimulus introduces a pressure for compositional language structure when we consider language evolution resulting from iterated observational learning. We use a mathematical model to map the space of parameters that result in compositional syntax. Our hypothesis is that compositional syntax cannot be explained by understanding the LAD alone: compositionality is an emergent property of the dynamics resulting from sparse language exposure.},

Computational models of linguistic evolution typically focus on the nature of, and conditions for, stable states. We take a novel approach and focus on understanding the process of linguistic evolution itself. What kind of evolutionary system is this process? Using visualization techniques, we explore the nature of replicators in linguistic evolution, and argue that replicators correspond to local regions of regularity in the mapping between meaning and signals. Based on this argument, we draw parallels between phenomena observed in the model and linguistic phenomena observed across languages. We then go on to identify issues of replication and selection as key points of divergence in the parallels between the processes of linguistic evolution and biological evolution.},

@article{brighton05review,
	Abstract = {John Maynard Smith and E{\"o}Szathm{\'a} argued that human language signified the eighth major transition in evolution: human language marked a new form of information transmission from one generation to another [Maynard Smith J, Szathm{\'a} E. The major transitions in evolution. Oxford: Oxford Univ. Press; 1995]. According to this view language codes cultural information and as such forms the basis for the evolution of complexity in human culture. In this article we develop the theory that language also codes information in another sense: languages code information on their own structure. As a result, languages themselves provide information that influences their own survival. To understand the consequences of this theory we discuss recent computational models of linguistic evolution. Linguistic evolution is the process by which languages themselves evolve. This article draws together this recent work on linguistic evolution and highlights the significance of this process in understanding the evolution of linguistic complexity. Our conclusions are that: (1) the process of linguistic transmission constitutes the basis for an evolutionary system, and (2), that this evolutionary system is only superficially comparable to the process of biological evolution.},

@inproceedings{brooks05cladistics,
	Abstract = {We describe the reconstruction of a phylogeny for a set of taxa, with a character-based cladistics approach, in a declarative knowledge representation formalism, and show how to use computational methods of answer set programming to generate conjectures about the evolution of the given taxa. We have applied this computational method in two domains: to historical analysis of languages, and to historical analysis of parasite-host systems. In particular, using this method, we have computed some plausible phylogenies for Chinese dialects, for Indo-European language groups, and for Alcataenia species. Some of these plausible phylogenies are different from the ones computed by other software. Using this method, we can easily describe domain specific information (e.g. temporal and geographical constraints), and thus prevent the reconstruction of some phylogenies that are not plausible.},

@article{broom02entropy,
	Abstract = {The application of information theory to biology can be broadly split into three areas: (i) At the level of the genome; considering the storage of information using the genetic code. (ii) At the level of the individual animal; communication between animals passes information from one animal to another (usually, but not always, for mutual benefit). (iii) At the level of the population; the diversity of a population can be measured using population entropy. This paper is concerned with the second area. We consider the evolution of an individual's ability to obtain and process information using the ideas of evolutionary game theory. An important part of game theory is the definition of the information available to the participants. Such games tend to treat information as a static quantity whilst behaviour is strategic. We consider game theoretic modelling where use of information is strategic and can thus evolve. A simple model is developed which shows how the information acquiring ability of animals can evolve through time. The model predicts that it is likely that there is an optimal level of information for any particular contest, rather than more information being inherently better. The total information required for optimal performance corresponded to approximately the same entropy, regardless of the value of the individual pieces of information concerned.},

@article{brown06phonologyEvolution,
	Abstract = {This paper explores a structure ubiquitous in grammar, the embedded tree, and develops a proposal for how such embedded structures played a fundamental role in the evolution of consonants and vowels. Assuming that linguistic capabilities emerged as a cognitive system from a simply reactive system and that such a transition required the construction of an internal mapping of the system body (cf. Cruse 2003), we propose that this mapping was determined through articulation and acoustics. By creating distinctions between articulators in the vocal tract or by acoustic features of sounds, and then embedding these distinctions, the various possible properties of consonants and vowels emerged. These embedded distinctions represent paradigmatic options for the production of sounds, which provide the basic building blocks for prosodic structure. By anchoring these embedded structures in the anatomy and physiology of the vocal tract, the evolution of phonology itself can be explained by extra-linguistic factors.},

Second, it introduces a conceptual framework for modeling cooperation in an artificial society. In this framework the environmental pressure to cooperate is controllable by a single parameter, thus allowing systematic investigations of system behavior under varying circumstances. Third, it reports upon results from experiments that implemented and tested environments based upon this new model of cooperation. The results show that the pressure to cooperate leads to the evolution of communication skills facilitating cooperation. Furthermore, higher levels of cooperation pressure lead to the emergence of increased communication.},

This modeling framework is based on simulations of population of cognitive agents that evolve linguistic capabilities by interacting with their social and physical environment (internal and external symbol grounding). These models provide an integrative vision of language where the linguistic abilities of cognitive agents strictly depend on other social, sensorimotor, neural and cognitive capabilities. Here language is not seen as an isolated and dedicated symbol processing system, but rather as a heterogeneous set of artifacts implicated in cultural and cognitive activities. The proposed modeling approach is also closely related to embodied cognition theories of the grounding of language in the organism's perceptual and motor systems.},

	Abstract = {The double function of language, as a social/communicative means, and as an individual/cognitive capability, derives from its fundamental property that allows us to internally re-represent the world we live in. This is possible through the mechanism of symbol grounding, i.e. the ability to associate entities and states in the external and internal world with internal categorical representations. The symbol grounding mechanism, as language, has both an individual and a social component. The individual component, called the ``Physical Symbol Grounding'', refers to the ability of each individual to create an intrinsic link between world entities and internal categorical representations. The social component, called ``Social Symbol Grounding'', refers to the collective negotiation for the selection of shared symbols (words) and their grounded meanings. The paper discusses these two aspects of symbol grounding in relation to distributed cognition, using examples from cognitive modeling research on grounded agents and robots.},

	Abstract = {This paper describes different types of models for the evolution of communication and language. It uses the distinction between signals, symbols, and words for the analysis of evolutionary models of language. In particular, it show how evolutionary computation techniques, such as Artificial Life, can be used to study the emergence of syntax and symbols from simple communication signals. Initially, a computational model that evolves repertoires of isolated signals is presented. This study has simulated the emer- gence of signals for naming foods in a population of foragers. This type of model studies communication systems based on simple signal-object associations. Subsequently, models that study the emergence of grounded symbols are discussed in general, including a detailed description of a work on the evolution of simple syntactic rules. This model focuses on the emergence of symbol-symbol relationships in evolved languages. Finally, computational models of syntax acquisition and evolution are discussed. These different types of computational models provide an operational definition of the signal/symbol/word distinction. The simulation and analysis of these types of models will help understanding the role of symbols and symbol acquisition in the origin of language.},

	Abstract = {Neural network models of categorical perception (compression of withincategory similarity and dilation of between-category differences) are applied to the symbol-grounding problem (of how to connect symbols with meanings) by connecting analogue sensorimotor projections to arbitrary symbolic representations via learned category-invariance detectors in a hybrid symbolic/non-symbolic system. Our nets are trained to categorize and name 50 2 50 pixel images (e.g. circles, ellipses, squares and rectangles) projected on to the receptive field of a 7 2 7 retina. They first learn to do prototype matching and then entry-level naming for the four kinds of stimuli, grounding their names directly in the input patterns via hidden-unit representations ('sensorimotor toil'). We show that a higher-level categorization (e.g. 'symmetric' versus 'asymmetric') can be learned in two very different ways: either (1) directly from the input, just as with the entry-level categories (i.e. by toil); or (2) indirectly, from Boolean combinations of the grounded category names in the form of propositions describing the higher-order category ('symbolic theft'). We analyse the architectures and input conditions that allow grounding (in the form of compression/ separation in internal similarity space) to be 'transferred' in this second way from directly grounded entry-level category names to higher-order category names. Such hybrid models have implications for the evolution and learning of language.},

More recently, such neural network approaches have been incorporated in studies based on cognitive agents and robots. In this paper we present a new model of symbol grounding transfer in cognitive robots. Language learning simulations demonstrate that robots are able to acquire new action concepts via linguistic instructions. This is achieved by autonomously transferring the grounding from directly grounded action names to new higher-order composite actions. The robot's neural network controller permits such a grounding transfer. The implications for such a modeling approach in cognitive science and autonomous robotics are discussed.},

Each individual¿s behavior is controlled by a neural network and we study the consequences in the network¿s internal functional organization of learning to process different classes of words. Agents are selected for reproduction according to their ability to manipulate objects and to understand nouns (objects¿ names) and verbs (manipulation tasks). The weights of the agents¿ neural networks are evolved using a genetic algorithm. Synthetic brain imaging techniques are then used to examine the functional organization of the neural networks. Results show that nouns produce more integrated neural activity in the sensory-processing hidden layer, while verbs produce more integrated synaptic activity in the layer where sensory information is integrated with proprioceptive input. Such findings are qualitatively compared with human brain imaging data that indicate that nouns activate more the posterior areas of the brain related to sensory and associative processing, while verbs activate more the anterior motor areas.},

The simulation methodology provides a unifying approach for the study of the evolution of language and its interaction with other behavioral and neural factors. The model uses an object manipulation task to simulate the evolution of language based on a simple verb-noun rule. The analyses of results focus on the interaction between language and other non-linguistic abilities, and on the neural control of linguistic abilities. The model shows that the beneficial effects of language on non-linguistic behavior are explained by the emergence of distinct internal representation patterns for the processing of verbs and nouns.},

When linguistic signals are produced to inform other individuals, individuals that respond appropriately to these signals may increase their reproductive chances but it is less clear what the reproductive advantage is for the language producers. We present simulations in which populations of neural networks living in an environment evolve a simple language with an informative function. Signals are produced to help other individuals categorize edible and poisonous mushrooms, in order to decide whether to approach or avoid encountered mushrooms. Language production, while not under direct evolutionary pressure, evolves as a byproduct of the independently evolving perceptual ability to categorize mushrooms.},

This paper presents an embodied model for the grounding of language in action based on epigenetic robots. Epigenetic robotics is one of the new cognitive modeling approaches to modeling autonomous mental development. The robot model is based on an integrative vision of language, in which linguistic abilities are strictly dependent on, and grounded in, other behaviors and skills. It uses simulated robots that learn through imitation the names of basic actions. Robots also learn higher-order action concepts through the process of grounding transfer. The simulation demonstrates how new, higher-order behavioral abilities can be autonomously built upon previously-grounded basic action categories, following linguistic interaction with human users.},

@article{castro04culturalTransmission,
	Abstract = {This paper presents the hypothesis that linguistic capacity evolved through the action of natural selection as an instrument which increased the efficiency of the cultural transmission system of early hominids. We suggest that during the early stages of hominization, hominid social learning, based on indirect social learning mechanisms and true imitation, came to constitute cumulative cultural transmission based on true imitation and the approval or disapproval of the learned behaviour of offspring. A key factor for this transformation was the development of a conceptual capacity for categorizing learned behaviour in value terms - positive or negative, good or bad. We believe that some hominids developed this capacity for categorizing behaviour, and such an ability allowed them to approve or disapprove of their offsprings- learned behaviour. With such an ability, hominids were favoured, as they could transmit to their offspring all their behavioural experience about what can and cannot be done. This capacity triggered a cultural transmission system similar to the human one, though pre-linguistic. We suggest that the adaptive advantage provided by this new system of social learning generated a selection pressure in favour of the development of a linguistic capacity allowing children to better understand the new kind of evaluative information received from parents.},

	Abstract = {Collaborative tagging has been quickly gaining ground because of its ability to recruit the activity of web users into effectively organizing and sharing vast amounts of information. Here we collect data from a popular system and investigate the statistical properties of tag cooccurrence. We introduce a stochastic model of user behavior embodying two main aspects of collaborative tagging: (i) a frequency-bias mechanism related to the idea that users are exposed to each other's tagging activity; (ii) a notion of memory, or aging of resources, in the form of a heavy-tailed access to the past state of the system. Remarkably, our simple modeling is able to account quantitatively for the observed experimental features with a surprisingly high accuracy. This points in the direction of a universal behavior of users who, despite the complexity of their own cognitive processes and the uncoordinated and selfish nature of their tagging activity, appear to follow simple activity patterns.},

@article{cavalli-sforza97genes,
	Abstract = {The genetic history of a group of populations is usually analyzed by reconstructing a tree of their origins. Reliability of the reconstruction depends on the validity of the hypothesis that genetic differentiation of the populations is mostly due to population fissions followed by independent evolution. If necessary, adjustment for major population admixtures can be made. Dating the fissions requires comparisons with paleoanthropological and paleontological dates, which are few and uncertain. A method of absolute genetic dating recently introduced uses mutation rates as molecular clocks; it was applied to human evolution using microsatellites, which have a sufficiently high mutation rate. Results are comparable with those of other methods and agree with a recent expansion of modern humans from Africa. An alternative method of analysis, useful when there is adequate geographic coverage of regions, is the geographic study of frequencies of alleles or haplotypes. As in the case of trees, it is necessary to summarize data from many loci for conclusions to be acceptable. Results must be independent from the loci used. Multivariate analyses like principal components or multidimensional scaling reveal a number of hidden patterns and evaluate their relative importance. Most patterns found in the analysis of human living populations are likely to be consequences of demographic expansions, determined by technological developments affecting food availability, transportation, or military power. During such expansions, both genes and languages are spread to potentially vast areas. In principle, this tends to create a correlation between the respective evolutionary trees. The correlation is usually positive and often remarkably high. It can be decreased or hidden by phenomena of language replacement and also of gene replacement, usually partial, due to gene flow.},

@article{cavalli-sforza83paradox,
	Abstract = {Communication between individuals of a species is likely to increase the capacity to acquire skills useful for survival and propagation and thus may confer important selective advantages. Since interaction occurs between two or more individuals, the selective process is frequency dependent, and the analysis shows that communication cannot initially increase at a reasonable rate when it is limited to random unrelated individuals, so that it is likely to abort for stochastic reasons. However, this bottleneck is removed if the communication process takes place in the nuclear family or among close relatives or if aggregation of communicators occurs because of assortative mating or meeting. Use of the individual conditional fitnesses we have introduced earlier permits an exact analysis. We show that, in general, the initial rate of increase can be geometric if and only if, in the class of selective models considered, the conditional probability of a communicator interacting with another contains a positive constant term. In our discussion of communication, cost factors for the act of communication have been omitted. However, the model has been generalized to include cooperativeness, and also altruism, or competition, by introducing costs. There is a close relationship among these situations, and the same considerations about the initial bottleneck and its resolution also extend to them. The models given here are for haploids but they extend to diploids and the conclusions are similar.},

This gap has now been filled by adapting to this aim a procedure based on the consistency index, and the level of significance is found to be much stronger than 10(-3).

@article{cernansky07neuralNetworks,
	Abstract = {Recurrent neural networks are often employed in the cognitive science community to process symbol sequences that represent various natural language structures. The aim is to study possible neural mechanisms of language processing and aid in development of artificial language processing systems. We used data sets containing recursive linguistic structures and trained the Elman simple recurrent network (SRN) for the next-symbol prediction task. Concentrating on neuron activation clusters in the recurrent layer of SRN we investigate the network state space organization before and after training. Given a SRN and a training stream, we construct predictive models, called neural prediction machines, that directly employ the state space dynamics of the network. We demonstrate two important properties of representations of recursive symbol series in the SRN. First, the clusters of recurrent activations emerging before training are meaningful and correspond to Markov prediction contexts. We show that prediction states that naturally arise in the SRN initialized with small random weights approximately correspond to states of Variable Memory Length Markov Models (VLMM) based on individual symbols (i.e. words). Second, we demonstrate that during training, the SRN reorganizes its state space according to word categories and their grammatical subcategories, and the next-symbol prediction is again based on the VLMM strategy. However, after training, the prediction is based on word categories and their grammatical subcategories rather than individual words. Our conclusion holds for small depths of recursions that are comparable to human performances. The methods of SRN training and analysis of its state space introduced in this paper are of a general nature and can be used for investigation of processing of any other symbol time series by means of SRN.},

	Abstract = {If we accept the view that language first evolved from the conceptual structure of our pre-linguistic ancestors, several questions arise, including: What kind of structure? Concepts about what? Here we review research on the vocal communication and cognition of nonhuman primates, focusing on results that may be relevant to the earliest stages of language evolution. From these data we conclude, first, that nonhuman primates' inability to represent the mental states of others makes their communication fundamentally different from human language. Second, while nonhuman primates' production of vocalizations is highly constrained, their ability to extract complex information from sounds is not. Upon hearing vocalizations, listeners acquire information about their social companions that is referential, discretely coded, hierarchically structured, rule-governed, and propositional. We therefore suggest that, in the earliest stages of language evolution, communication had a formal structure that grew out of its speakers' knowledge of social relations.},

However, a lack of appropriate validation of simulation experiments against real language data often calls into question the general applicability of these methods in modeling realistic language change. We try to address this issue here by making an attempt to model the phenomenon of schwa deletion in Hindi through a multi-agent simulation framework. The pattern of Hindi schwa deletion and its diachronic nature are well studied, not only out of general linguistic inquiry, but also to facilitate Hindi grapheme-to-phoneme conversion, which is a preprocessing step to text-to-speech synthesis. We show that under certain conditions, the schwa deletion pattern observed in modern Hindi emerges in the system from an initial state of no deletion. The simulation framework described in this work can be extended to model other phonological changes as well.},

In this work we try to model such similarities observed in the consonant inventories, through a complex bipartite network. We present a systematic study of some of the appealing features of these inventories with the help of the bipartite network. An important observation is that the occurrence of consonants follows a two regime power law distribution. We find that the consonant inventory size distribution together with the principle of preferential attachment are the main reasons behind the emergence of such a two regime behavior. In order to further support our explanation we present a synthesis model for this network based on the general theory of preferential attachment.},

	Abstract = {This thesis presents a connectionist theory of how infinite languages may fit within nite minds. Arguments are presented against the distinction between linguistic competence and observable language performance. It is suggested that certain kinds of finite state automata--i.e., recurrent neural networks|are likely to have sufficient computational power, and the necessary generalization capability, to serve as models for the processing and acquisition of linguistic structure. These arguments are further corroborated by a number of computer simulations, demonstrating that recurrent connectionist models are able to learn complex recursive regularities and have powerful generalization abilities. Importantly, the performance evinced by the networks are comparable with observed human behavior on similar aspects of language. Moreover, an evolutionary account is provided, advocating a learning and processing based explanation of the origin and subsequent phylogenetic development of language. This view construes language as a nonobligate symbiant, arguing that language has evolved to fit human learning and processing mechanisms, rather than vice versa. As such, this perspective promises to explain linguistic universals in functional terms, and motivates an account of language acquisition which incorporates innate, but not language-specific constraints on the learning process. The purported poverty of the stimulus is re-appraised in this light, and it is concluded that linguistic structure may be learnable by bottom-up statistical learning models, such as, connectionist neural networks.},

@unpublished{christiansen07languageBrain,
	Abstract = {It is widely assumed that human learning and the structure of human languages are intimately related. This relationship is frequently suggested to be rooted in a language-specific biological endowment, which encodes universal, but arbitrary, principles of language structure (a universal grammar or UG). How might such a UG have evolved? We argue that UG could not have arisen either by biological adaptation or non- adaptationist genetic processes. The resulting puzzle concerning the origin of UG we call the logical problem of language evolution. Because the processes of language change are much more rapid than processes of genetic change, language constitutes a ``moving target'' both over time and across different human populations, and hence cannot provide a stable environment to which UG genes could have adapted. We conclude that a biologically determined UG is not evolutionarily viable. Instead, the original motivation for UG---the mesh between learners and languages---arises because language has been shaped to fit the human brain, rather than vice versa. Following Darwin, we view language itself as a complex and interdependent ``organism,'' which evolves under selectional pressures from human learning and processing mechanisms. That is, languages are themselves undergoing severe selectional pressure from each generation of language users and learners. This suggests that apparently arbitrary aspects of linguistic structure may result from general learning and processing biases, independent of language. We illustrate how this framework can integrate evidence from different literatures and methodologies to explain core linguistic phenomena, including binding constraints, word order universals, and diachronic language change.},

	Abstract = {Naturally occurring speech contains only a limited amount of complex recursive structure, and this is reflected in the empirically documented difficulties that people experience when processing such structures. We present a connectionist model of human performance in processing recursive language structures. The model is trained on simple artificial languages. We find that the qualitative performance profile of the model matches human behavior, both on the relative difficulty of center-embedding and cross-dependency, and between the processing of these complex recursive structures and right-branching recursive constructions. We analyze how these differences in performance are reflected in the internal representations of the model by performing discriminant analyses on these representations both before and after training. Furthermore, we show how a network trained to process recursive structures can also generate such structures in a probabilistic fashion. This work suggests a novel explanation of people's limited recursive performance, without assuming the existence of a mentally represented competence grammar allowing unbounded recursion.},

@incollection{christiansen02linguisticAdaptation,
	Abstract = {<b>Introduction</b> <p> The acquisition and processing of language is governed by a number of universal constraints, many of which undoubtedly derive from innate properties of the human brain. These constraints lead to certain universal tendencies in how languages are structured and used. More generally, the constraints help explain why the languages of the world take up only a small part of the considerably larger space de. ned by the logically possible linguistic subpatterns. Although there is broad consensus about the existence of innate constraints on the way language is acquired and processed, there is much disagreement over whether these constraints are linguistic or cognitive in nature. Determining the nature of these constraints is important not only for theories of language acquisition and processing, but also for theories of language evolution. Indeed, these issues are theoretically intertwined because the constraints on language define the endpoints for evolutionary explanations: theories about how the constraints evolved in the hominid lineage are thus strongly determined by what the nature of these constraints is taken to be. <p> The Chomskyan approach to language suggests that the constraints on the acquisition and processing of language are linguistic, rather than cognitive, in nature. Th e constraints are represented in the form of a Universal Grammar (UG)---a large biological endowment of linguistic knowledge (e.g. Chomsky 1986). It is assumed that this knowledge-base is highly abstract, comprising a complex set of linguistic rules and principles that could not be acquired from exposure to language during development. Opinions differ about how UG emerged as the endpoint of language evolution. Some researchers have suggested that it evolved through a gradual process of natural selection (e.g., Newmeyer 1991; Pinker 1994; Pinker and Bloom 1990), whereas others have argued for a sudden emergence through non-adaptationist evolutionary processes (e.g., Bickerton 1995; Piattelli-Palmarini 1989). An important point of agreement is the emphasis in their explanations of language evolution on the need for very substantial biological changes to accommodate linguistic structure. <p> More recently an alternative perspective is gaining ground, advocating a refocus in thinking about language evolution. Rather than concentrating on biological changes to accommodate language, this approach stresses the adaptation of linguistic structures to the biological substrate of the human brain (e.g., Batali 1998; Christiansen 1994; Christiansen and Devlin 1997; Deacon 1997; Kirby 1998, 2000, 2001). Languages are viewed as dynamic systems of communication, subject to selection pressures arising from limitations on human learning and processing. Some approaches within this framework have built in a certain amount of linguistic machinery, such as context-free grammars (Kirby 2000). In this chapter we argue that many of the constraints on linguistic adaptation derive from non-linguistic limitations on the learning and processing of hierarchically organized sequential structure. Th ese mechanisms existed prior to the appearance of language, but presumably also underwent changes aft er the emergence of language. However, the selection pressures are likely to have come not only from language but also from other kinds of complex hierarchical processing, such as the need for increasingly complex manual combinations following tool sophistication. Consequently, many language universals may re. ect nonlinguistic, cognitive constraints on learning and processing of sequential structure rather than an innate UG.},

	Abstract = {Sequential learning plays a role in a variety of common tasks, such as human language processing, animal communication, and the learning of action sequences. In this article, we investigate sequential learning in non-human primates from a comparative perspective, focusing on three areas: the learning of arbitrary, fixed sequences; statistical learning; and the learning of hierarchical structure. Although primates exhibit many similarities to humans in their performance on sequence learning tasks, there are also important differences. Crucially, non-human primates appear to be limited in their ability to learn and represent the hierarchical structure of sequences. We consider the evolutionary implications of these differences and suggest that limitations in sequential learning may help explain why non-human primates lack human-like language.},

@article{corballis92cognition,
	Abstract = {One of the properties that most conspicuously distinguishes human language from any other form of animal communication is generativity. Language with this property therefore presumably evolved with the Homo line somewhere between H. habilis and H. sapiens sapiens. Some have suggested that it emerged relatively suddenly and completely with H. sapiens sapiens, and this view is consistent with (a) linguistic estimates as to when vocal language emerged, (b) the relatively late 'explosion' of manufacture and cultural artifacts such as body ornamentation and cave drawings, and (c) evidence on changes in the vocal apparatus. However, evidence on brain size and developmental patterns of growth suggests an earlier origin and a more continuous evolution. I propose that these scenarios can be reconciled if it is supposed that generative language evolved, perhaps from H. habilis on, as a system of manual gestures, but switched to a predominantly vocal system with H. sapiens sapiens. The subsequent 'cultural explosion' can then be attributed to the freeing of the hands from primary involvement in language, so that they could be exploited, along with generativity, for manufacture, art, and other activities.},

@incollection{coupe05polygenesis,
	Abstract = {On the one hand, numerous hypotheses have been put forward to account for the emergence of language during the last million years of human evolution. On the other hand, a large majority of linguists considers that nothing can be said about past languages before 8,000 or 10,000 years in the past, given our current knowledge on modern languages. A large gap obviously separates such approaches and conceptions, and has to be crossed to provide a better account of the development of our communicative system. To partially bridge the gap between the former domains, we aim at proposing a plausible scenario for the emergence of languages, with an emphasis on the development of linguistic diversity. The present study will address the question of the monogenesis or polygenesis of modern languages, which is often implicitly biased toward the first hypothesis. Probabilistic and computational models, as well as palaeo-demographic data and evolutionary considerations, will constitute the key points of our proposals.},

@article{croft02languageDarwinization,
	Abstract = {Linguistics and evolutionary biology have substantially diverged until recently. The chief reason for this divergence was the dominance of essentialist thinking in linguistics during the twentieth century. Croft (2000) describes a thoroughgoing application of Hull's (1988) generalized theory of selection to language change. In this model, tokens of linguistic structure in utterances (`linguemes') are replicators and speakers are interactors. Current debates in the philosophy of evolutionary biology (e.g. Sterelny and Griffiths, 1999) are then applied to language change. Hull's generalized theory is post-synthesis: it recognizes a distinction between replicator and interactor and is independent of levels of biological organization. Biological issues such as mechanisms of inheritance (e.g. Lamarckism) and of selection (e.g. intentional behavior) are simply irrelevant to the generalized theory of selection outside biology. However, there are many striking parallels between biological evolution and language change that are likely to be consequences of the generalized theory of selection, including flexibility of adaptation to the environment, emergent structure, evolutionary conservatism, vestigial traits, exaptation, and the absence of ``progress''. The evolutionary theory of language change is not evolutionary psychology, but it is mimetics; this approach is defended against Sterelny and Griffith's criticisms.},

This rebalancing permits broader coverage of empirical linguistic phenomena and promises a tighter integration of linguistic theory into the cognitive scientific enterprise.

@article{dallasta06microscopicPatterns,
	Abstract = {The models of statistical physics used to study collective phenomena in some interdisciplinary contexts, such as social dynamics and opinion spreading, do not consider the effects of the memory on individual decision processes. On the contrary, in the Naming Game, a recently proposed model of Language formation, each agent chooses a particular state, or opinion, by means of a memory-based negotiation process, during which a variable number of states is collected and kept in memory. In this perspective, the statistical features of the number of states collected by the agents becomes a relevant quantity to understand the dynamics of the model, and the influence of topological properties on memory-based models. By means of a master equation approach, we analyze the internal agent dynamics of Naming Game in populations embedded on networks, finding that it strongly depends on very general topological properties of the system (e.g. average and fluctuations of the degree). However, the influence of topological properties on the microscopic individual dynamics is a general phenomenon that should characterize all those social interactions that can be modeled by memory-based negotiation processes.},

	Abstract = {In this paper we analyze the effect of a non-trivial topology on the dynamics of the so-called Naming Game, a recently introduced model which addresses the issue of how shared conventions emerge spontaneously in a population of agents. We consider in particular the small-world topology and study the convergence towards the global agreement as a function of the population size $N$ as well as of the parameter $p$ which sets the rate of rewiring leading to the small-world network. As long as $p \gg 1/N$ there exists a crossover time scaling as $N/p^2$ which separates an early one-dimensional-like dynamics from a late stage mean-field-like behavior. At the beginning of the process, the local quasi one-dimensional topology induces a coarsening dynamics which allows for a minimization of the cognitive effort (memory) required to the agents. In the late stages, on the other hand, the mean-field like topology leads to a speed up of the convergence process with respect to the one-dimensional case.},

@article{dallasta06languageGamesNetworks,
	Abstract = {The Naming Game is a model of non-equilibrium dynamics for the self-organized emergence of a linguistic convention or a communication system in a population of agents with pairwise local interactions. We present an extensive study of its dynamics on complex networks, that can be considered as the most natural topological embedding for agents involved in language games and opinion dynamics. Except for some community structured networks on which metastable phases can be observed, agents playing the Naming Game always manage to reach a global consensus. This convergence is obtained after a time generically scaling with the population's size $N$ as $t\_{conv} \sim N^{1.4 \pm 0.1}$, i.e. much faster than for agents embedded on regular lattices. Moreover, the memory capacity required by the system scales only linearly with its size. Particular attention is given to heterogenous networks, in which the dynamical activity pattern of a node depends on its degree. High degree nodes have a fundamental role, but require larger memory capacity. They govern the dynamics acting as spreaders of (linguistic) conventions. The effects of other properties, such as the average degree and the clustering, are also discussed.},

First, different levels of narrative intelligence are discussed in the context of human and robotic story-tellers. Then, we introduce a computational framework which is based on minimal definitions of stories, story-telling and autobiographic agents. An experimental test-bed is described which is applied to the study of story-telling, using robotic agents as examples of situated, autonomous minimal agents. Experimental data are provided which support the working hypothesis that story-telling can be advantageous, i.e. increases the survival of an autonomous, autobiographic, minimal agent. We conclude this paper by discussing implications of this approach for story-telling in humans and artifacts.},

As soon as we begin to look at human neuroanatomy and development from a comparative perspective, it is possible to recognize a number of ways that human brains diverge from the general pattern of other ape and monkey brains. These divergences may offer clues to language evolution. Large-scale quantitative changes in the relative proportions of brain regions (as opposed to just overall expansion) offer some of the most obvious clues. Additional information about how axons are guided in their extensions to distant developmental targets and how competitive trophic processes sculpt these connections also provides a way to understand how gross quantitative changes in cell numbers could affect circuit organization and ultimately behavior.},

	Abstract = {The correlations between interpopulation genetic and linguistic diversities are mostly noncausal (spurious), being due to historical processes and geographical factors that shape them in similar ways. Studies of such correlations usually consider allele frequencies and linguistic groupings (dialects, languages, linguistic families or phyla), sometimes controlling for geographic, topographic, or ecological factors. Here, we consider the relation between allele frequencies and linguistic typological features. Specifically, we focus on the derived haplogroups of the brain growth and development-related genes ASPM and Microcephalin, which show signs of natural selection and a marked geographic structure, and on linguistic tone, the use of voice pitch to convey lexical or grammatical distinctions. We hypothesize that there is a relationship between the population frequency of these two alleles and the presence of linguistic tone and test this hypothesis relative to a large database (983 alleles and 26 linguistic features in 49 populations), showing that it is not due to the usual explanatory factors represented by geography and history. The relationship between genetic and linguistic diversity in this case may be causal: certain alleles can bias language acquisition or processing and thereby influence the trajectory of language change through iterated cultural transmission.},

	Abstract = {The origin of phonological systems is examined from the paradigm of self-organization. We claim that phonological systems could have emerged as the product of self-organizing processes. Self-organization may have facilitated the evolution of structures within the sounds that humans were able to produce. One of the main points of the paper concerns the identification of the processes which could account for the self-organized behavior of sound systems used in languages spoken by humans. In this paradigm, phonological systems or sound patterns of human languages are emergent properties of these systems rather than properties imposed by some external influence. Regulations are defined as the constraints that adjust the rate of production of the elements of a system to the state of the system and of relevant environmental variables. The main operators of these adjustments are feedback loops. Two types of processes can be distinguished in regulatory networks, homeostatic and epigenetic. Since the origin of sound patterns, of human languages, is in the vocal tract constraints, we make the hypothesis that sound change does not reflect any adaptive character but rather is the phonetic modality of differentiation understood as epigenetic regulation.},

Why do we feel the urge to communicate with our fellows, and why is this form of communication, characterised by relevance, unique in animal kingdom ? In this chapter, we will first stress this specificity of human communication. In a second part, using computer evolutionary simulations, we will dismiss the usual claim that human communication is a specific form of reciprocal cooperation. A Darwinian account of language requires that we find a selective advantage in the communication act. We will propose, in the third part of this chapter, that such an advantage can be found if we consider language activity in the broader frame of human social organisation. In the continuation of the 'chimpanzee politics' studied by de Waal (1982), the ability to form large coalitions must have been an essential feature of hominid societies (Dunbar 1996). We will suggest that relevant speech originated in this context, as a way for individuals to select each other to form alliances.},

We show that reciprocal cooperation, which is generally invoked to explain non-kin altruism, requires very restrictive conditions to be evolutionary stable. Some of these conditions are not met in many cases of altruism observed in nature. In the search of another explanation of non-kin altruism, we consider Zahavis's theory of prestige. We extend it to propose a 'political' model of altruism. We give evidence showing that non-kin altruism can evolve in the context of inter-subgroup competition. Under such circumstances, altruistic behavior can be used by individuals to advertise their quality as efficient coalition members. In this model, only abilities which positively correlate with the subgroup success can evolve into altruistic behaviors.},

Our aim is to show that any scenario of language origin should explain the relevance phenomenon. Why do people feel obliged to be relevant in casual conversation ? Analysing the structure of relevance leads to unexpected conclusions : relevant information is valuable, therefore language seems to be altruistic. As a consequence, from a Darwinian perspective, speakers should be rare and continually prompted for their knowledge. What we observe, however, is the exact opposite : in many situations, speakers repeatedly strive to make their point, while listeners systematically evaluate what they hear. A possible solution to this paradox is that language is not altruistic and that relevant information is traded for status. The observation of spontaneous conversation provides some evidence that supports such a hypothesis.},

@inproceedings{debeule06compositionality,
	Abstract = {Compositionality is a hallmark of human language - words and morphemes can be factorially combined to produce a seemingly limitless number of viable strings. This contrasts with nonhuman communication systems, which for the most part are holistic - encoding a whole message through a single, gestalt form. Why does every human language adopt a compositional strategy? In this paper, we show that compositional language can arise automatically through grounded communication among populations of communicators. The proposed mechanism is the following: if a holistic and a compositional approach are in competition and if both structured (compositional) and atomic meanings need to be communicated, the holistic strategy becomes less successful as it does not recruit already acquired bits of language. We demonstrate the viability of this explanation through computer simulations in which populations of artificial agents perform a communicative task - describing scenes that they have observed. Successful language strategies (that is, those yielding successful transmission of information about a scene) are reinforced while unsuccessful ones are demoted. The simulations show that this reinforcement on the basis of communicative success indeed leads to the dominance of compositional language as long as the fraction of unstructured meaning to be communicated is sufficiently high. Moreover, following Elman (1993), we then show that the same effect can be achieved by, instead of manipulating the world (the fraction of unstructured meaning presented to the agents), letting the agents themselves go through developmental stages. These simulations confirm that simple reinforcement mechanisms applied during communicative interactions can account for the emergence of linguistic compositionality.},

@inproceedings{beule02groundingFormalSyntax,
	Abstract = {Human, syntactic language is one of the most intriguing behaviors and receives increasing attention from researchers in numerous fields. Here we present a model that goes an important step further than previous work because it explicitly connects low-level perception and categorization, hierarchical meaning construction and syntactic language. The model thus shows a solution to the `symbol grounding problem' (Harnad, 1990): the meaning of the symbolic system -- logical symbols and syntactic rules -- is grounded in its relation with a simplified but realistic world. We discuss the different components of this collaborative effort: (i) a realistic simulation of Newtonian dynamics of objects in a 2D plane; (ii) schemabased event-perception and categorization; (iii) a semantics based on predicate logic; and (iv) a categorial grammar for the production and interpretation of language. The integration of the different components poses on the one hand novel and important constraints; on the other hand, it allows for experiments that help to identify the relations between the different levels. We note some important similarities and differences with SHRDLU (Winograd, 1976) and the Talking Heads experiment (Steels et al., 2002), and give an agenda for future experiments.},

This is investigated in a computer experiment in which a population of artificial agents constructs a shared language to talk about a world that can be conceptualized in multiple and possibly conflicting ways. It is argued that the establishment of a successful communication system requires that feedback about the communicative success is propagated to the ontological level, and thus that language shapes the way we conceptualize the world for communication.},

@inproceedings{DeBeule06Cross_Situational_learning,
	Abstract = {There is a growing body of research on multi-agent systems bootstrapping a communication system. Most studies are based on simulation, but recently there has been an increased interest in the properties and formal analysis of these systems. Although very interesting and promising results have been obtained in these studies, they always rely on major simplifications. For example, although much larger populations are considered than was the case in most earlier work, previous work assumes the possibility of meaning transfer. With meaning transfer, two agents always exactly know what they are talking about. This is hardly ever the case in actual communication systems, as noise corrupts the agents' perception and transfer of meaning. In this paper we first consider what happens when relaxing the meaning-transfer assumption, and propose a cross-situational learning scheme that allows a population of agents to still bootstrap a common lexicon under this condition. We empirically show the validity of the scheme and thereby improve on the results reported in (Smith, 2003) and (Vogt and Coumans, 2003) in which no satisfactory solution was found. It is not our aim to reduce the importance of previous work, instead we are excited by recent results and hope to stimulate further research by pointing towards some new challenges.},

In particular, we propose a hybrid mechanism that combines cross-situational learning techniques with more informed feedback mechanisms. In our study we focus our attention on dealing with referential indeterminacy after joint attention has been established and on whether the current model can deal with larger populations than previous studies involving cross-situational learning.

In addition, we vary the amount of corrective feedback provided to guide learning word-meanings.

@article{dipaolo00behavioralCoordination,
	Abstract = {Social coordination is studied in a simulated model of autonomous embodied agents that interact acoustically. Theoretical concepts concerning social behavior are presented from a systemic perspective and their usefulness is evaluated in interpreting the results obtained. Two agents moving in an unstructured arena must locate each other, and remain within a short distance of one another for as long as possible using noisy continuous acoustic interaction. Evolved dynamical recurrent neural networks are used as the control architecture. Acoustic coupling poses nontrivial problems like discriminating `self' from `non-self' and structuring production of signals in time so as to minimize interference. Detailed observation of the most frequently evolved behavioral strategy shows that interacting agents perform rhythmic signals leading to the coordination of movement. During coordination, signals become entrained in an anti-phase mode that resembles turn-taking. Perturbation techniques show that signalling behavior not only performs an external function, but it is also integrated into the movement of the producing agent, thus showing the difficulty of separating behavior into social and non- social classes. Structural congruence between agents is shown by exploring internal dynamics as well as the response of single agents in the presence of signalling beacons that reproduce the signal patterns of the interacting agents. Lack of entrainment with the signals produced by the beacons shows the importance of transient periods of mutual dynamic perturbation wherein agents achieve congruence.},

	Abstract = {An exploration is presented of the interplay between the situated activity of embodied autonomous organisms and the social dynamics they constitute in interaction, with special emphasis on evolutionary, ecological and behavioral aspects. The thesis offers a series of theoretical and methodological criticisms of recent investigations on the biology of social behavior and animal communication. An alternative theoretical framework, based on a systemic theory of biological autonomy, is provided to meet these criticisms and the elaboration of the corresponding theoretical arguments is supported by the construction and analysis of mathematical and computational models. <p> A game of action coordination is studied by a series of game-theoretic, ecological and computational models which, by means of systematic comparisons, permit the identification of the evolutionary relevance of different factors like finite populations, ecological and genetic constraints, spatial patterns, discreteness and stochasticity. Only in an individual-based model is it found that cooperative action coordination is evolutionarily stable. This is due to the emergence of spatial clusters in the spatial distribution of players which break many of the in-built symmetries of the game and act as invariants of the dynamics constraining the path of viable evolution. <p> An extension to this model explores other structuring effects by adding the possibility of parental influences on phenotypic development. The result is a further stabilization of cooperative coordination which is explained by the presence of self-promoting networks of developmental relationships which enslave the evolutionary dynamics. <p> The behavioral aspects involved in the attainment of a coordinated state between autonomous systems are studied in a simulated model of embodied agents coupled through an acoustic medium. Agents must locate and approach each other only by means of continuous acoustic signals. The results show the emergence of synchronized rhythmic signalling patterns that resemble turn-taking which is accompanied by coherent patterns of movement. It is demonstrated that coordination results from the achievement of structural congruence between the agents during interaction.},

@article{dipaolo98anInvestigation,
	Abstract = {This article presents a theoretical criticism of current approaches to the study of the evolution of communication. In particular two very common preconceptions about the subject are analysed: the role of natural selection in the definition of the phenomenon and the metaphor of communication as information exchange. An alternative characterization is presented in terms of autopoietic theory which avoids the mentioned preconceptions. In support of this view, the evolution of coordinated activity is studied in a population of artificial agents playing an interactional game. Dynamical modeling of this evolutionary process based on game-theoretic considerations shows the existence of an evolutionarily stable strategy in the total lack of coordinated activity which, however, may be unreachable due to the presence of a periodic attractor. In a computational model of the same game, action coordination evolves, even with individual costs against it, due to the presence of spatial structuring processes. A detailed explanation of this phenomenon, which does not require kin selection, is presented. In an extended game, recursive coordination evolves nontrivially when the participants share all the relevant information, demonstrating that the metaphor of information exchange can be misleading. It is shown that agents engaged in this sort of interaction are able to perform beyond their individual capabilities.},

A brief review of the functional neurophysiology of the cortex and basal ganglia will be provided as background for a neural network model of this system in sensorimotor sequence learning. Sequential behavior is then defined in terms of serial, temporal and abstract structure. The resulting neuro-computational framework is demonstrated to account for observed sequence learning behavior. More interestingly, this framework naturally extends to grammatical constructions as form-to-meaning mappings. Predictions from the neuro-computational model concerning parallels in language and cognitive sequence processing are tested against behavioral and neurophysiological observations in humans, resulting in a refinement of the allocation of model functions to subdivisions of Broca's area. From a functional perspective this analysis will provide insight into the relation between the coding structure in human languages, and constraints derived from the underlying neurophysiological computational mechanisms.},

In the proposed system, meaning (in terms of descriptions of events and spatial relations) is extracted from video images based on detection of position, motion, physical contact and their parameters. Meaning extraction requires attentional mechanisms that are implemented from low-level perceptual primitives. Mapping of sentence form to meaning is performed by learning grammatical constructions, i.e., sentence to meaning mappings as defined by Goldberg [Goldberg, A. (1995). Constructions. Chicago and London: Univ. of Chicago Press]. These are stored and retrieved from a ``construction inventory'' based on the constellation of grammatical function words uniquely identifying the target sentence structure. The resulting system displays robust acquisition behavior that reproduces certain observations from developmental studies, with very modest ``innate'' language specificity.},

	Abstract = {This paper is an attempt to construct a programmatic framework for the evolution of human language. First, we pres- ent a novel characterization of language, which is based on some of the most recent research results in linguistics. As these results suggest, language is best characterized as a specialized communication system, dedicated to the expres- sion of a surprisingly constrained set of meanings. This characterization calls for an account of the evolution of lan- guage in terms of the interaction between cultural and genetic evolution. We develop such an evolutionary model on the basis of the mechanism of culturally-driven genetic assimilation. As we show, a careful analysis of the diverse effects of this mechanism derives some of the most crucial properties of the evolved linguistic capacity as a specific, functional communication system.},

	Abstract = {Human language may be described as a complex network of linked words. In such a treatment, each distinct word in language is a vertex of this web, and interacting words in sentences are connected by edges. The empirical distribution of the number of connections of words in this network is of a peculiar form that includes two pronounced power-law regions. Here we propose a theory of the evolution of language, which treats language as a self-organizing network of interacting words. In the framework of this concept., we completely describe the observed word web structure without any fitting. We show that the two regimes in the distribution naturally emerge from the evolutionary dynamics of the word web. It follows front our theory that the size of the core part of language, the 'kernel lexicon', does not vary as language evolves.},

	Abstract = {There is an ongoing debate about whether the words in the first languages spoken by humans expressed single concepts or complex holophrases. A computer model was used to investigate the nature of the protolanguages that would arise if speakers could associate words and meanings, but lacked any productive ability beyond saying the word whose past uses most closely matched the meaning that they wished to express. It was found that both words expressing single concepts, and holophrastic words could arise, depending on the conceptual and articulatory abilities of the agents. However, most words were of an intermediate type, as they expressed more than a single concept but less than a holophrase. The model therefore demonstrates that protolanguages may have been of types that are not usually considered in the debate over the nature of the first human languages.},

@inproceedings{dowman05colourTerms,
	Abstract = {The effect of adding noise to an expression-induction model of language evolution was investigated. The model consisted of a number of artificial people who were able to infer the denotation of basic colour terms from examples of colours which the words had been used to identify, using a Bayesian inference procedure. The artificial people would express colours to one-another, so producing data from which other people could learn. Occasionally they would be creative, which allowed new words to enter the language. When certain points in the colour space were made especially salient, so that the artificial people were more likely to remember colours at these points, the languages emerging over a number of generations in evolutionary simulations replicated the typological patterns seen in the 110 languages of the world colour survey. It was found that if random noise was added to the data from which the artificial people learned, this had no major effect on the emergent languages, demonstrating that the Bayesian inference procedure is able to learn effectively despite the presence of random noise, even when placed in an evolutionary context.},

@phdthesis{dowman04PhD-ColorLanguage,
	Abstract = {This thesis investigates language acquisition and evolution, using the methodologies of Bayesian inference and expression-induction modelling, making specific reference to colour term typology, and syntactic acquisition. In order to test Berlin and Kay's (1969) hypothesis that the typological patterns observed in basic colour term systems are produced by a process of cultural evolution under the influence of universal aspects of human neurophysiology, an expression-induction model was created. Ten artificial people were simulated, each of which was a computational agent. These people could learn colour term denotations by generalizing from examples using Bayesian inference, and the resulting denotations had the prototype properties characteristic of basic colour terms. Conversations between these people, in which they learned from one-another, were simulated over several generations, and the languages emerging at the end of each simulation were investigated. The proportion of colour terms of each type correlated closely with the equivalent frequencies found in the World Colour Survey, and most of the emergent languages could be placed on one of the evolutionary trajectories proposed by Kay and Maffi (1999). The simulation therefore demonstrates how typological patterns can emerge as a result of learning biases acting over a period of time. <p> Further work applied the minimum description length form of Bayesian inference to modelling syntactic acquisition. The particular problem investigated was the acquisition of the dative alternation in English. This alternation presents a learnability paradox, because only some verbs alternate, but children typically do not receive reliable evidence indicating which verbs do not participate in the alternation (Pinker, 1989). The model presented in this thesis took note of the frequency with which each verb occurred in each subcategorization, and so was able to infer which subcategorizations were conspicuously absent, and so presumably ungrammatical. Crucially, it also incorporated a measure of grammar complexity, and a preference for simpler grammars, so that more general grammars would be learned unless there was sufficient evidence to support the incorporation of some restriction. The model was able to learn the correct subcategorizations for both alternating and non-alternating verbs, and could generalise to allow novel verbs to appear in both constructions. When less data was observed, it also overgeneralized the alternation, which is a behaviour characteristic of children when they are learning verb subcategorizations. These results demonstrate that the dative alternation is learnable, and therefore that universal grammar may not be necessary to account for syntactic acquisition. Overall, these results suggest that the forms of languages may be determined to a much greater extent by learning, and by cumulative historical changes, than would be expected if the universal grammar hypothesis were correct.},

	Abstract = {Computational models were constructed to investigate how the meanings of basic colour terms were learned, and to determine why these words have prototype properties, and why they partition the colour space. A Bayesian model of acquisition was able to learn colo ur term systems with these properties, but could equally well learn colour term systems which did not partition the colour space or have prototype properties, and so it failed to explain the empirical data concerning these words. Computational evolutionary simulations were then conducted by creating a community of artificial people using multiple copies of the Bayesian model. These artificial people then learned colour words from one-another, and colour term systems were allowed to evolve over a number of generations. The emergent colour terms always partitioned the colour space and had prototype properties. These results demonstrate that the Bayesian model is able to account for the properties of colour term systems only when it is placed in a social contex t and so they provide evidence of the importance of understanding language as a product of both psychology and social interaction.},

If so, the key to understanding language is to understand innate learning biases, and the process of biological evolution through which they have evolved. Using mathematical and computer modelling, we show how a very small bias towards regularity can be accentuated by the process of cultural transmission in which language is passed from generation to generation, resulting in languages that are overwhelmingly regular. Cultural evolution therefore plays as big a role as prior bias in determining the form of emergent languages, showing that language can only be explained in terms of the interaction of biological evolution, individual development, and cultural transmission.},

@article{dunbar93coevolutionOf,
	Abstract = {oup size is a function of relative neocortical volume in nonhuman primates. Extrapolation from this regression equation yields a predicted group size for modern humans very similar to that of certain hunter-gatherer and traditional horticulturalist societies. Groups of similar size are also found in other large-scale forms of contemporary and historical society. Among primates, the cohesion of groups is maintained by social grooming; the time devoted to social grooming is linearly related to group size among the Old World monkeys and apes. To maintain the stability of the large groups characteristic of humans by grooming alone would place intolerable demands on time budgets. It is suggested that (1) the evolution of large groups in the human lineage depended on the development of a more efficient method for time-sharing the processes of social bonding and that (2) language uniquely fulfills this requirement. Data on the size of conversational and other small interacting groups of humans are in line with the predictions for the relative efficiency of conversation compared to grooming as a bonding process. Analysis of a sample of human conversations shows that about 60% of time is spent gossiping about relationships and personal experiences. It is suggested that language evolved to allow individuals to learn about the behavioural characteristics of other group members more rapidly than is possible by direct observation alone.},

Here it is shown that the application of biological cladistic methods, not to vocabulary (as has been previously tried) but to language structure (sound systems and grammar), may extend the time depths at which language data can be used. The method was tested against well-understood families of Oceanic Austronesian languages, then applied to the Papuan languages of Island Melanesia, a group of hitherto unrelatable isolates. Papuan languages show an archipelago-based phylogenetic signal that is consistent with the current geographical distribution of languages. The most plausible hypothesis to explain this result is the divergence of the Papuan languages from a common ancestral stock, as part of late Pleistocene dispersals.},

Developmental processes are particularly emphasized. Analysis of developmental processes, processes such as human embryonic development, children's verbal development, and adolescents' scientific conceptual development reveals the unifying principle referred to as 'condensation' - the successive shortening of developmental stages. The mechanism of condensation is coupled to the rate of evolutionary change. <p> The analysis examines the applicability of the concept of the meme. Regarding the evolution of language, we suggest a cooperative combination of genetic and memetic replication; while early on in the evolution of science only memetic replication is envisaged.},

@article{elman93cognition,
	Abstract = {It is a striking fact that in humans the greatest learning occurs precisely at that point in time - childhood - when the most dramatic maturational changes also occur. This report describes possible synergistic interactions between maturational change and the ability to learn a complex domain (language), as investigated in connectionist networks. The networks are trained to process complex sentences involving relative clauses, number agreement, and several types of verb argument structure. Training fails in the case of networks which are fully formed and `adultlike' in their capacity. Training succeeds only when networks begin with limited working memory and gradually `mature' to the adult state. This result suggests that rather than being a limitation, developmental restrictions on resources may constitute a necessary prerequisite for mastering certain complex domains. Specifically, successful learning may depend on starting small.},

@article{elman90findingStructure,
	Abstract = {Time underlies many interesting human behaviors. Thus, the question of how to represent time in connectionist models is very important. One approach is to represent time implicitly by its effects on processing rather than explicitly (as in a spatial representation). The current report develops a proposal along these lines first described by Jordan (1986) which involves the use of recurrent links in order to provide networks with a dynamic memory. In this approach, hidden unit patterns are fed back to themselves; the internal representations which develop thus reflect task demands in the context of prior internal states. A set of simulations is reported which range from relatively simple problems (temporal version of XOR) to discovering syntactic/semantic features for words. The networks are able to learn interesting internal representations which incorporate task demands with memory demands; indeed, in this approach the notion of memory is inextricably bound up with task processing. These representations reveal a rich structure, which allows them to be highly context-dependent while also expressing generalizations across classes of items. These representations suggest a method for representing lexical categories and the type/token distinction.},

@article{enard02FOXP2,
	Abstract = {Language is a uniquely human trait likely to have been a prerequisite for the development of human culture. The ability to develop articulate speech relies on capabilities, such as fine control of the larynx and mouth, that are absent in chimpanzees and other great apes. FOXP2 is the first gene relevant to the human ability to develop language. A point mutation in FOXP2 co-segregates with a disorder in a family in which half of the members have severe articulation difficulties accompanied by linguistic and grammatical impairment. This gene is disrupted by translocation in an unrelated individual who has a similar disorder. Thus, two functional copies of FOXP2 seem to be required for acquisition of normal spoken language. We sequenced the complementary DNAs that encode the FOXP2 protein in the chimpanzee, gorilla, orang-utan, rhesus macaque and mouse, and compared them with the human cDNA. We also investigated intraspecific variation of the human FOXP2 gene. Here we show that human FOXP2 contains changes in amino-acid coding and a pattern of nucleotide polymorphism, which strongly suggest that this gene has been the target of selection during recent human evolution.},

Languages not only inherit characteristics from their ancestors but also sometimes borrow them from other languages. Such borrowings can be represented by additional non-tree edges. This paper addresses the problem of com- puting a small number of additional edges that turn a phylogeny into a 'perfect phylogenetic network'. To solve this problem, we use answer set programming, which represents a given computational problem as a logic program whose answer sets correspond to solutions. Using the answer set solver smodels, with some heuristics and optimization tech- niques, we have generated a few conjectures regarding the evolution of Indo-European languages.},

@article{ferrer06isolatedSignals,
	Abstract = {Here, we study a communication model where signals associate to stimuli. The model assumes that signals follow Zipf's law and the exponent of the law depends on a balance between maximizing the information transfer and saving the cost of signal use. We study the effect of tuning that balance on the structure of signal-stimulus associations. The model starts from two recent results. First, the exponent grows as the weight of information transfer increases. Second, a rudimentary form of language is obtained when the network of signal-stimulus associations is almost connected. Here, we show the existence of a sudden destruction of language once a critical balance is crossed. The model shows that maximizing the information transfer through isolated signals and language are in conflict. The model proposes a strong reason for not finding large exponents in complex communication systems: language is in danger. Besides, the findings suggest that human words may need to be ambiguous to keep language alive. Interestingly, the model predicts that large exponents should be associated to decreased synaptic density. It is not surprising that the largest exponents correspond to schizophrenic patients since, according to the spirit of Feinberg's hypothesis, i.e. decreased synaptic density may lead to schizophrenia. Our findings suggest that the exponent of Zipf's law is intimately related to language and that it could be used to detect anomalous structure and organization of the brain.},

@article{ferrer05zipfLawVariation,
	Abstract = {Words in humans follow the so-called Zipf's law. More precisely, the word frequency spectrum follows a power function, whose typical exponent is $\beta \approx 2$, but significant variations are found. We hypothesize that the full range of variation reflects our ability to balance the goal of communication, i.e. maximizing the information transfer and the cost of communication, imposed by the limitations of the human brain. We show that the higher the importance of satisfying the goal of communication, the higher the exponent. Here, assuming that words are used according to their meaning we explain why variation in $\beta$ should be limited to a particular domain. From the one hand, we explain a non-trivial lower bound at about $\beta=1.6$ for communication systems neglecting the goal of the communication. From the other hand, we find a sudden divergence of $\beta$ if a certain critical balance is crossed. At the same time a sharp transition to maximum information transfer and unfortunately, maximum communication cost, is found. Consistently with the upper bound of real exponents, the maximum finite value predicted is about $\beta=2.4$. It is convenient for human language not to cross the transition and remain in a domain where maximum information transfer is high but at a reasonable cost. Therefore, only a particular range of exponents should be found in human speakers. The exponent $\beta$ contains information about the balance between cost and communicative efficiency.},

The exponents are consistent with minimizing the entropy of words. The model differs from a previous model [Ferrer i Cancho, Sol{\'e}Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. USA 100, 788--791 (2003)] in two aspects. First, it assumes that the probability of experiencing a certain stimulus is controlled by the internal structure of the communication system rather than by the probability of experiencing it in the `outside' world, which makes it specially suitable for the speech of schizophrenics. Second, the exponent ? predicted for the frequency versus rank distribution is in a range where ?>1, which may explain that of some schizophrenics and some children, with ?=1.5-1.6. Among the many models for Zipf's law, none explains Zipf's law for that particular range of exponents. In particular, two simplistic models fail to explain that particular range of exponents: intermittent silence and Simon's model. We support that Zipf's law in a communication system may maximize the information transfer under constraints.},

	Abstract = {Here, assuming a general communication model where objects map to signals, a power function for the distribution of signal frequencies is derived. The model relies on the satisfaction of the receiver (hearer) communicative needs when the entropy of the number of objects per signal is maximized. Evidence of power distributions in a linguistic context (some of them with exponents clearly different from the typical \beta \approximate 2 of Zipf's law) is reviewed and expanded. We support the view that Zipf's law reflects some sort of optimization but following a novel realistic approach where signals (e.g. words) are used according to the objects (e.g. meanings) they are linked to. Our results strongly suggest that many systems in nature use non-trivial strategies for easing the interpretation of a signal. Interestingly, constraining just the number of interpretations of signals does not lead to scaling.},

	Abstract = {Until recently, models of communication have explicitly or implicitly assumed that the goal of a communication system is just maximizing the information transfer between signals and 'meanings'. Recently, it has been argued that a natural communication system not only has to maximize this quantity but also has to minimize the entropy of signals, which is a measure of the cognitive cost of using a word. The interplay between these two factors, i.e. maximization of the information transfer and minimization of the entropy, has been addressed previously using a Monte Carlo minimization procedure at zero temperature. Here we derive analytically the globally optimal communication systems that result from the interaction between these factors. We discuss the implications of our results for previous studies within this framework. In particular we prove that the emergence of Zipf's law using a Monte Carlo technique at zero temperature in previous studies indicates that the system had not reached the global optimum.},

Recent approaches to the evolution of language formalize why syntax is selectively advantageous compared with isolated signal communication systems, but do not explain how signals naturally combine. Even more recent work has shown that if a communication system maximizes communicative efficiency while minimizing the cost of communication, or if a communication system constrains ambiguity in a non-trivial way while a certain entropy is maximized, signal frequencies will be distributed according to Zipf's law. Here we show that such communication principles give rise not only to signals that have many traits in common with the linking words in real human languages, but also to a rudimentary sort of syntax and symbolic reference.},

@article{ferrer03leasteffort,
	Abstract = {The emergence of a complex language is one of the fundamental events of human evolution, and several remarkable features suggest the presence of fundamental principles of organization. These principles seem to be common to all languages. The best known is the so-called Zipf's law, which states that the frequency of a word decays as a (universal) power law of its rank. The possible origins of this law have been controversial, and its meaningfulness is still an open question. In this article, the early hypothesis of Zipf of a principle of least effort for explaining the law is shown to be sound. Simultaneous minimization in the effort of both hearer and speaker is formalized with a simple optimization process operating on a binary matrix of signal-object associations. Zipf's law is found in the transition between referentially useless systems and indexical reference systems. Our finding strongly suggests that Zipf's law is a hallmark of symbolic reference and not a meaningless feature. The implications for the evolution of language are discussed. We explain how language evolution can take advantage of a communicative phase transition.},

Here, random texts and real texts are compared through (a) the so-called lexical spectrum and (b) the distribution of words having the same length.

This construction process is extremely fast and robust. The co-occurrence of words in sentences reflects language organization in a subtle manner that can be described in terms of a graph of word interactions. Here, we show that such graphs display two important features recently found in a disparate number of complex systems. (i) The so called small-world effect. In particular, the average distance between two words, d (i.e. the average minimum number of links to be crossed from an arbitrary word to another), is shown to be d approximate to 2-3, even though the human brain can store many thousands. (ii) A scale-free distribution of degrees. The known pronounced effects of disconnecting the most connected vertices in such networks can be identified in some language disorders. These observations indicate some unexpected features of language organization that might reflect the evolutionary and social history of lexicons and the origins of their flexibility and combinatorial nature.},

@incollection{fitch05musicEvolution,
	Abstract = {In this paper, I briefly review some comparative data that provide an empirical basis for research on the evolution of music making in humans. First, a brief comparison of music and language leads to discussion of design features of music, suggesting a deep connection between the biology of music and language. I then selectively review data on animal ``music.'' Examining sound production in animals, we find examples of repeated convergent evolution or analogy (the evolution of vocal learning of complex songs in birds, whales, and seals). A fascinating but overlooked potential homology to instrumental music is provided by manual percussion in African apes. Such comparative behavioral data, combined with neuroscientific and developmental data, provide an important starting point for any hypothesis about how or why human music evolved. Regarding these functional and phylogenetic questions, I discuss some previously proposed functions of music, including Pinker's ``cheesecake'' hypothesis; Darwin's and others' sexual selection model; Dunbar's group ``grooming'' hypothesis; and Trehub's caregiving model. I conclude that only the last hypothesis receives strong support from currently available data. I end with a brief synopsis of Darwin's model of a songlike musical ``protolanguage,'' concluding that Darwin's model is consistent with much of the available evidence concerning the evolution of both music and language. There is a rich future for empirical investigations of the evolution of music, both in investigations of individual differences among humans, and in interspecific investigations of musical abilities in other animals, especially those of our ape cousins, about which we know little.},

@article{fitch05comparativeReview,
	Abstract = {For many years the evolution of language has been seen as a disreputable topic, mired in fanciful ``just so stories'' about language origins. However, in the last decade a new synthesis of modern linguistics, cognitive neuroscience and neo-Darwinian evolutionary theory has begun to make important contributions to our understanding of the biology and evolution of language. I review some of this recent progress, focusing on the value of the comparative method, which uses data from animal species to draw inferences about language evolution. Discussing speech first, I show how data concerning a wide variety of species, from monkeys to birds, can increase our understanding of the anatomical and neural mechanisms underlying human spoken language, and how bird and whale song provide insights into the ultimate evolutionary function of language. I discuss the ``descended larynx'' of humans, a peculiar adaptation for speech that has received much attention in the past, which despite earlier claims is not uniquely human. Then I will turn to the neural mechanisms underlying spoken language, pointing out the difficulties animals apparently experience in perceiving hierarchical structure in sounds, and stressing the importance of vocal imitation in the evolution of a spoken language. Turning to ultimate function, I suggest that communication among kin (especially between parents and offspring) played a crucial but neglected role in driving language evolution. Finally, I briefly discuss phylogeny, discussing hypotheses that offer plausible routes to human language from a non-linguistic chimp-like ancestor. I conclude that comparative data from living animals will be key to developing a richer, more interdisciplinary understanding of our most distinctively human trait: language.},

@article{fitch00speech,
	Abstract = {The evolution of speech can be studied independently of the evolution of language, with the advantage that most aspects of speech acoustics, physiology and neural control are shared with animals, and thus open to empirical investigation. At least two changes were necessary prerequisites for modern human speech abilities: (1) modification of vocal tract morphology, and (2) development of vocal imitative ability. Despite an extensive literature, attempts to pinpoint the timing of these changes using fossil data have proven inconclusive. However, recent comparative data from nonhuman primates have shed light on the ancestral use of formants (a crucial cue in human speech) to identify individuals and gauge body size. Second, comparative analysis of the diverse vertebrates that have evolved vocal imitation (humans, cetaceans, seals and birds) provides several distinct, testable hypotheses about the adaptive function of vocal mimicry. These developments suggest that, for understanding the evolution of speech, comparative analysis of living species provides a viable alternative to fossil data. However, the neural basis for vocal mimicry and for mimesis in general remains unknown.},

@article{fitch05languageFaculty,
	Abstract = {In this response to Pinker and Jackendoff's critique, we extend our previous framework for discussion of language evolution, clarifying certain distinctions and elaborating on a number of points. In the first half of the paper, we reiterate that profitable research into the biology and evolution of language requires fractionation of ``language'' into component mechanisms and interfaces, a non-trivial endeavor whose results are unlikely to map onto traditional disciplinary boundaries. Our terminological distinction between FLN and FLB is intended to help clarify misunderstandings and aid interdisciplinary rapprochement. By blurring this distinction, Pinker and Jackendoff mischaracterize our hypothesis 3 which concerns only FLN, not ``language'' as a whole. Many of their arguments and examples are thus irrelevant to this hypothesis. Their critique of the minimalist program is for the most part equally irrelevant, because very few of the arguments in our original paper were tied to this program; in an online appendix we detail the deep inaccuracies in their characterization of this program. Concerning evolution, we believe that Pinker and Jackendoff's emphasis on the past adaptive history of the language faculty is misplaced. Such questions are unlikely to be resolved empirically due to a lack of relevant data, and invite speculation rather than research. Preoccupation with the issue has retarded progress in the field by diverting research away from empirical questions, many of which can be addressed with comparative data. Moreover, offering an adaptive hypothesis as an alternative to our hypothesis concerning mechanisms is a logical error, as questions of function are independent of those concerning mechanism. The second half of our paper consists of a detailed response to the specific data discussed by Pinker and Jackendoff. Although many of their examples are irrelevant to our original paper and arguments, we find several areas of substantive disagreement that could be resolved by future empirical research. We conclude that progress in understanding the evolution of language will require much more empirical research, grounded in modern comparative biology, more interdisciplinary collaboration, and much less of the adaptive storytelling and phylogenetic speculation that has traditionally characterized the field.},

Lexicon learners should also explicitly attempt to increase the mutual information between their symbol usages (a measure of the usefulness of the symbols for transferring information between agents). This paper argues that, although many lexicon learning algorithms presented in the literature do attempt to create highly informative symbol usages implicitly, there are good reasons to make the mutual information of symbol usages an explicit goal of the lexicon learning system. Some first steps in this direction are provided in this paper. It presents lexicon learning experiments using both purely imitative and explicitly information maximizing algorithms. The results of these experiments are used to support the thesis of this paper, that lexicon learning algorithms should explicitly attempt to produce high mutual information symbol usages.},

@article{floreano07robotsCommunication,
	Abstract = {Information transfer plays a central role in the biology of most organisms, particularly social species [1, 2]. Although the neurophysiological processes by which signals are produced, conducted, perceived, and interpreted are well understood, the conditions conducive to the evolution of communication and the paths by which reliable systems of communication become established remain largely unknown. This is a particularly challenging problem because efficient communication requires tight coevolution between the signal emitted and the response elicited [3]. We conducted repeated trials of experimental evolution with robots that could produce visual signals to provide information on food location. We found that communication readily evolves when colonies consist of genetically similar individuals and when selection acts at the colony level. We identified several distinct communication systems that differed in their efficiency. Once a given system of communication was well established, it constrained the evolution of more efficient communication systems. Under individual selection, the ability to produce visual signals resulted in the evolution of deceptive communication strategies in colonies of unrelated robots and a concomitant decrease in colony performance. This study generates predictions about the evolutionary conditions conducive to the emergence of communication and provides guidelines for designing artificial evolutionary systems displaying spontaneous communication.},

@article{fogassi04mirrorNeurons,
	Abstract = {Different theories have been proposed for explaining the evolution of language. One of this maintains that gestural communication has been the precursor of human speech. Here we present a series of neurophysiological evidences that support this hypothesis. Communication by gestures, defined as the capacity to emit and recognize meaningful actions, may have originated in the monkey motor cortex from a neural system whose basic function was action understanding. This system is made by neurons of monkey&#146;s area F5, named <I>mirror neurons</I>, activated by both execution and observation of goal-related actions. Recently, two new categories of mirror neurons have been described. Neurons of one category respond to the sound of an action, neurons of the other category respond to the observation of mouth ingestive and communicative actions. The properties of these neurons indicate that monkey's area F5 possesses the basic neural mechanisms for associating gestures and meaningful sounds as a pre-adaptation for the later emergence of articulated speech. The homology and the functional similarities between monkey area F5 and Broca&#146;s area support this evolutionary scenario.},

@article{fontanari07compositionality,
	Abstract = {Evolutionary language games have proved a useful tool to study the evolution of communication codes in communities of agents that interact among themselves by transmitting and interpreting a fixed repertoire of signals. Most studies have focused on the emergence of Saussurean codes (i.e., codes characterized by an arbitrary one-to-one correspondence between meanings and signals). In this contribution, we argue that the standard evolutionary language game framework cannot explain the emergence of compositional codes-communication codes that preserve neighborhood relationships by mapping similar signals into similar meanings-even though use of those codes would result in a much higher payoff in the case that signals are noisy. We introduce an alternative evolutionary setting in which the meanings are assimilated sequentially and show that the gradual building of the meaning-signal mapping leads to the emergence of mappings with the desired compositional property.},

@article{forster03phylogeneticChronology,
	Abstract = {Indo-European is the largest and best-documented language family in the world, yet the reconstruction of the Indo-European tree, first proposed in 1863, has remained controversial. Complications may include ascertainment bias when choosing the linguistic data, and disregard for the wave model of 1872 when attempting to reconstruct the tree. Essentially analogous problems were solved in evolutionary genetics by DNA sequencing and phylogenetic network methods, respectively. We now adapt these tools to linguistics, and analyze Indo-European language data, focusing on Celtic and in particular on the ancient Celtic language of Gaul (modern France), by using bilingual Gaulish-Latin inscriptions. Our phylogenetic network reveals an early split of Celtic within Indo-European. Interestingly, the next branching event separates Gaulish (Continental Celtic) from the British (Insular Celtic) languages, with Insular Celtic subsequently splitting into Brythonic (Welsh, Breton) and Goidelic (Irish and Scottish Gaelic). Taken together, the network thus suggests that the Celtic language arrived in the British Isles as a single wave (and then differentiated locally), rather than in the traditional two-wave scenario ('P-Celtic' to Britain and 'Q-Celtic' to Ireland). The phylogenetic network furthermore permits the estimation of time in analogy to genetics, and we obtain tentative dates for Indo-European at 8100 BC &#177; 1,900 years, and for the arrival of Celtic in Britain at 3200 BC &#177; 1,500 years. The phylogenetic method is easily executed by hand and promises to be an informative approach for many problems in historical linguistics.},

@article{freedman96languagePolygenesis,
	Abstract = {Monogenesis of language is widely accepted, but the conventional argument seems to be mistaken; a simple probabilistic model shows that polygenesis is likely. Other prehistoric inventions are discussed, as are problems in tracing linguistic lineages. Language is a system of representations; within such a system, words can evoke complex and systematic responses. Along with its social functions, language is important to humans as a mental instrument. Indeed, the invention of language,that is the accumulation of symbols to represent emotions, objects, and acts may be the most important event in human evolution, because so many developments follow from it. For example, Edward Sapir speculated that some embryonic form of language must have been available to early man to help him fashion tools from stone (Sapir,1921). Sophisticated biface stone tools date to early Homo erectus some 1.5 million years ago, suggesting a similar age for language. This paper considers whether the invention of language occurred at only one pre-historic site or at several sites. In other words, did language emerge by monogenesis or polygenesis? Early thinkers believed in monogenesis, against a background of divine creation. Perhaps the best known account is the biblical story of Adam giving names to plants and animals in the Garden of Eden. Similar legends are found among many peoples. Modern linguists too assume monogenesis, but on probabilistic grounds (see, for instance, Southworth and Daswani, 1974, p.314). The argument seems to be that the invention of language is an extremely unlikely event, because symbolization involves abstraction and requires synchronized insight by several individuals; therefore, the probability of occurrence at more than one site must be vanishingly small. We have found no explicit quantitative treatment of this question in the literature, but the underlying logic has to be the multiplication of probabilities. If p is small at one site,then p.p for two sites is smaller still, and so on. This reasoning is false, as we show here. The fallacy lies in the focus on two particular sites rather than consideration of all pairs of sites.},

@article{Galantucci05humanCommunication,
	Abstract = {The emergence of human communication systems is typically investigated via 2 approaches with complementary strengths and weaknesses: naturalistic studies and computer simulations. This study was conducted with a method that combines these approaches. Pairs of participants played video games requiring communication. Members of a pair were physically separated but exchanged graphic signals through a medium that prevented the use of standard symbols (e.g., letters). Communication systems emerged and developed rapidly during the games, integrating the use of explicit signs with information implicitly available to players and silent behavior-coordinating procedures. The systems that emerged suggest 3 conclusions: (a) signs originate from different mappings; (b) sign systems develop parsimoniously; (c) sign forms are perceptually distinct, easy to produce, and tolerant to variations.},

	Abstract = {We start by providing an evolutionary scenario for the emergence of semantics. It is argued that the evolution of anticipatory cognition and theory of mind in the hominids opened up for cooperation about future goals. This cooperation requires symbolic communication. The meanings of the symbols are established via a ``meeting of minds.'' The concepts in the minds of communicating individuals are modelled as convex regions in conceptual spaces. We then outline a mathematical framework based on fixpoints in continuous mappings between conceptual spaces that can be used to model such a semantics.},

@article{gentner06songbirds,
	Abstract = {Humans regularly produce new utterances that are understood by other members of the same language community. Linguistic theories account for this ability through the use of syntactic rules (or generative grammars) that describe the acceptable structure of utterances. The recursive, hierarchical embedding of language units (for example, words or phrases within shorter sentences) that is part of the ability to construct new utterances minimally requires a 'context-free' grammar that is more complex than the 'finite-state' grammars thought sufficient to specify the structure of all non-human communication signals. Recent hypotheses make the central claim that the capacity for syntactic recursion forms the computational core of a uniquely human language faculty. Here we show that European starlings (Sturnus vulgaris) accurately recognize acoustic patterns defined by a recursive, self-embedding, context-free grammar. They are also able to classify new patterns defined by the grammar and reliably exclude agrammatical patterns. Thus, the capacity to classify sequences from recursive, centre-embedded grammars is not uniquely human. This finding opens a new range of complex syntactic processing mechanisms to physiological investigation.},

	Abstract = {We discuss which properties common-use artifacts should have to collaborate without human intervention. We conceive how devices, such as mobile phones, PDAs, and home appliances, could be seamlessly integrated to provide an ``ambient intelligence'' that responds to the users desires without requiring explicit programming or commands. While the hardware and software technology to build such systems already exists, yet there is no protocol to direct and give meaning to their interactions. We propose the first steps in the development of such a protocol, which would need to be adaptive, extensible, and open to the community, while promoting self-organization. We argue that devices, interacting through ``game-like'' moves, can learn to agree about how to communicate, with whom to cooperate, and how to delegate and coordinate specialized tasks. Like this, they may evolve distributed cognition or collective intelligence able to tackle any complex of tasks.},

	Abstract = {Isolating-Monocategorial-Associational (IMA) Language is language with the following three properties: (a) morphologically isolating, without word-internal morphological structure; (b) syntactically monocategorial, without distinct syntactic categories; and (c) semantically associational, without distinct construction-specific semantic rules, compositional semantics relying instead on the association operator, which says that the meaning of a composite expression is associated with the meanings of its constituents in an underspecified fashion. IMA Language is present in the following five domains: (a) phylogeny: at some stage in evolution, early language was IMA Language; (b) ontogeny: at some stage in acquisition, early child language is IMA Language; (c) semiotics: some artificial languages are IMA Language; (d) typology: some languages are closer than others to IMA Language; and (e) cognition: IMA Language is a feature of general human cognition. This paper presents arguments pertaining to the first of these domains, namely phylogeny, citing evidence from the linguistic behaviour of captive apes which points towards the conclusion that early human language was IMA Language.},

@article{gold67limit,
	Abstract = {Language learnability has been investigated. This refers to the following situation: A class of possible languages is specified, together with a method of presenting information to the learner about an unknown language, which is to be chosen from the class. The question is now asked, ``Is the information sufficient to determine which of the possible languages is the unknown language?'' Many definitions of learnability are possible, but only the following is considered here: Time is quantized and has a finite starting time. At each time the learner receives a unit of information and is to make a guess as to the identity of the unknown language on the basis of the information received so far. This process continues forever. The class of languages will be considered learnable with respect to the specified method of information presentation if there is an algorithm that the learner can use to make his guesses, the algorithm having the following property: Given any language of the class, there is some finite time after which the guesses will all be the same and they will be correct. <p> In this preliminary investigation, a language is taken to be a set of strings on some finite alphabet. The alphabet, is the same for all languages of the class. Several variations of each of the following two basic methods of information presentation are investigated: A text for a language generates the strings of the language in any order such that every string of the language occurs at. least once. An informant for a language tells whether a string is in the language, and chooses the strings in some order such that every string occurs at least once. It was found that the class of context-sensitive languages is learnable from an informant, but that, not even the class of regular languages is learnable from a text.},

	Abstract = {Collaborative tagging describes the process by which many users add metadata in the form of keywords to shared content. Recently, collaborative tagging has grown in popularity on the web, on sites that allow users to tag bookmarks, photographs and other content. In this paper we analyze the structure of collaborative tagging systems as well as their dynamical aspects. Specifically, we discovered regularities in user activity, tag frequencies, kinds of tags used, bursts of popularity in bookmarking and a remarkable stability in the relative proportions of tags within a given url. We also present a dynamical model of collaborative tagging that predicts these stable patterns and relates them to imitation and shared knowledge.},

@article{goldinmeadow98spontaneousSignSystems,
	Abstract = {Deaf children whose access to usable conventional linguistic input, signed or spoken, is severely limited nevertheless use gesture to communicate. These gestures resemble natural language in that they are structured at the level both of sentence and of word. Although the inclination to use gesture may be traceable to the fact that the deaf children's hearing parents, like all speakers, gesture as they talk, the children themselves are responsible for introducing language-like structure into their gestures. We have explored the robustness of this phenomenon by observing deaf children of hearing parents in two cultures, an American and a Chinese culture, that differ in their child-rearing practices and in the way gesture is used in relation to speech. The spontaneous sign systems developed in these cultures shared a number of structural similarities: patterned production and deletion of semantic elements in the surface structure of a sentence; patterned ordering of those elements within the sentence; and concatenation of propositions within a sentence. These striking similarities offer critical empirical input towards resolving the ongoing debate about the 'innateness' of language in human infants.},

@article{goldman07learningToCommunicate,
	Abstract = {Abstract Learning to communicate is an emerging challenge in AI research. It is known that agents interacting in decentralized, stochastic environments can benefit from exchanging information. Multi-agent planning generally assumes that agents share a common means of communication; however, in building robust distributed systems it is important to address potential miscoordination resulting from misinterpretation of messages exchanged. This paper lays foundations for studying this problem, examining its properties analytically and empirically in a decision-theoretic context. We establish a formal framework for the problem, and identify a collection of necessary and sufficient properties for decision problems that allow agents to employ probabilistic updating schemes in order to learn how to interpret what others are communicating. Solving the problem optimally is often intractable, but our approach enables agents using different languages to converge upon coordination over time. Our experimental work establishes how these methods perform when applied to problems of varying complexity.},

Empirical results shed light on the complexity of the learning problem, and on factors affecting the speed of convergence. Designing intelligent agents able to adapt their mutual interpretation of messages exchanged, in order to improve overall task-oriented performance, introduces an essential cognitive capability that can upgrade the current state of the art in multi-agent and human-machine systems to the next level.

A coevolution of lexicon and syntax (in the form of simple word order) is tracked during communications with indirect meaning transference, in which the listener's comprehension is based on interactions of linguistic and nonlinguistic information, and the feedback is not a direct meaning check. In this model, homonymous and synonymous rules emerge inevitably, and a sufficiently developed communication system is available only when a homonym-avoidance mechanism is adopted. In addition, certain degrees of heterogeneity regarding agent's natural characteristics and linguistic behaviors do not significantly affect language emergence. Finally, based on theories of complex networks, a preliminary study of social structure's influence on language emergence is given, and a coevolution of the emergence of language and that of simple social structure is implemented.},

	Abstract = {This paper suggests a model of the process through which a set of symbols, initially without any intrinsic meaning, acquires endogenously a conventional and socially shared meaning. This model has two related aspects. The first is the cognitive aspect, represented by the process through which each agent processes the information gathered during the interactions with other agents. In this paper, the agents are endowed with the cognitive skills necessary to categorize the input in a lexicographic way, a categorization process that is implemented by the means of data mining techniques. The second aspect is the social one, represented by the process of reiterate interactions among the agents who compose a population. The framework of this social process is that of evolutionary game theory, with a population of agents who are randomly matched in each period in order to play a game that, in this paper, is a kind of signaling game. The simulations show that the emergence of a socially shared meaning associated to a combination of symbols is, under the assumptions of this model, a statistically inevitable occurrence.},

	Abstract = {This paper suggests a model of the process through which a set of symbols, initially without any intrinsic meaning, acquires endogenously a conventional and socially shared meaning. This model has two related aspects. The first is the cognitive aspect, represented by the process through which each agent processes the information gathered during the interactions with other agents. In this paper, the agents are endowed with the cognitive skills necessary to categorize the input in a lexicographic way, a categorization process that is implemented by the means of data mining techniques. The second aspect is the social one, represented by the process of reiterate interactions among the agents who compose a population. The framework of this social process is that of evolutionary game theory, with a population of agents who are randomly matched in each period in order to play a game that, in this paper, is a kind of signaling game. The simulations show that the emergence of a socially shared meaning associated to a combination of symbols is, under the assumptions of this model, a statistically inevitable occurrence.},

@article{grafen93whyESSsignalling,
	Abstract = {Evolutionarily stable strategy (ESS) models of biological signalling are important because the intimate coevolution of signalling and receiving strategies is complicated. Tentative results from a numerical study of error-prone signalling show the value of formal modelling. Error in perception can create discreteness in the distribution of signals produced, and so observed discreteness in nature may call for no more complicated explanation. Further developments in the theory of signalling may include a link with theories of aggression such as the sequential assessment game. The technical device of a 'scratch space' may allow a natural development of 'two-way' information games in which each contestant plays the roles of signaller and receiver simultaneously. This device may also incidentally derive mental states from purely strategic considerations.},

	Abstract = {Evolutionary models of communication are used to shed some light on the selective pressures involved in the evolution of simple referential signals, and the constraints hindering the emergence of signs. Error-prone communication results from errors in transmission (in which individuals learn the wrong associations) and communication (in which signs are mistaken for one another). We demonstrate how both classes of errors are required to generate diversity and subsequently impose limits on the sign repertoire within a population. We then explore the influence of geographic structuring of a population on the evolution of a shared sign system and the importance of such structure for the maintenance of sign diversity. Deceit tends to erode conventional signs systems thereby reducing signal diversity, we demonstrate that population structure can act as a hedge against deceit, thereby ensuring the persistence of sign systems.},

The origin of the Indo-European language family is ``the most intensively studied, yet still most recalcitrant, problem of historical linguistics''. Numerous genetic studies of Indo-European origins have also produced inconclusive results. Here we analyse linguistic data using computational methods derived from evolutionary biology. We test two theories of Indo-European origin: the 'Kurgan expansion' and the 'Anatolian farming' hypotheses. The Kurgan theory centres on possible archaeological evidence for an expansion into Europe and the Near East by Kurgan horsemen beginning in the sixth millennium BP. In contrast, the Anatolian theory claims that Indo-European languages expanded with the spread of agriculture from Anatolia around 8,000-9,500 years BP. In striking agreement with the Anatolian hypothesis, our analysis of a matrix of 87 languages with 2,449 lexical items produced an estimated age range for the initial Indo-European divergence of between 7,800 and 9,800 years BP. These results were robust to changes in coding procedures, calibration points, rooting of the trees and priors in the bayesian analysis.},

@article{griffiths07iteratedLearning,
	Abstract = {Languages are transmitted from person to person and generation to generation via a process of iterated learning: people learn a language from other people who once learned that language themselves. We analyze the consequences of iterated learning for learning algorithms based on the principles of Bayesian inference, assuming that learners compute a posterior distribution over languages by combining a prior (representing their inductive biases) with the evidence provided by linguistic data. We show that when learners sample languages from this posterior distribution, iterated learning converges to a distribution over languages that is determined entirely by the prior. Under these conditions, iterated learning is a form of Gibbs sampling, a widely-used Markov chain Monte Carlo algorithm. The consequences of iterated learning are more complicated when learners choose the language with maximum posterior probability, being affected by both the prior of the learners and the amount of information transmitted between generations. We show that in this case, iterated learning corresponds to another statistical inference algorithm, a variant of the expectation-maximization (EM) algorithm. These results clarify the role of iterated learning in explanations of linguistic universals and provide a formal connection between constraints on language acquisition and the languages that come to be spoken, suggesting that information transmitted via iterated learning will ultimately come to mirror the minds of the learners.},

	Abstract = {We extend previous work by modeling evolution of communication using a spatialized genetic algorithm which recombines strategies purely locally. Here cellular automata are used as a spatialized environment in which individuals gain points by capturing drifting food items and are 'harmed' if they fail to hide from migrating predators. Our individuals are capable of making one of two arbitrary sounds, heard only locally by their immediate neighbors. They can respond to sounds from their neighbors by opening their mouths or by hiding. By opening their mouths in the presence of food they maximize gains; by hiding when a predator is present they minimize losses. We consider the result a 'natural' template for benefits from communication; unlike a range of other studies, it is here only the recipient of communicated information that immediately benefits. A community of 'perfect communicators' could be expected to make a particular sound when successfully feeding, responding to that same sound from their neighbors by opening their mouths. They could be expected to make a different sound when 'hurt' and respond to that second sound from their neighbors by hiding. Suppose one starts from a small set of 'Adam and Eve' strategies randomized across a cellular automata array, and uses a genetic algorithm which operates purely locally by cross-breeding strategies with their most successful neighbors. Can one, in such an environment, expect evolution of local communities of 'perfect communicators'? With some important qualifications, the answer is 'yes'.},

Only now are the lessons of spatialization being learned in a related field: game-theoretic models for cooperation. In work on altruism, on the other hand, the role of spatial organization has long been recognized under the term `viscosity'. <br/> Here we offer some simple simulations that dramatize the importance of spatialization for studies of both cooperation and communication, in each case contrasting (a) a model dynamics in which strategy change proceeds globally, and (b) a spatialized model dynamics in which interaction and strategy change both operate purely locally. Local action in a spatialized model clearly favors the emergence of cooperation. In the case of communication, spatialized models allow communication to arise and flourish where the global dynamics more typical in the literature make it impossible. <br/> Simulations make a dramatic case for spatialized modeling, but analysis proves difficult. In a final section we outline some of the surprises of spatial dynamics but also some of the complexity facing attempts at deeper analysis.},

@article{hare95learningAnd,
	Abstract = {An account is offered to change over time in English verb morphology, based on a connectionist approach to how morphological knowledge is acquired and used. A technique is first described that was developed for modeling historical change in connectionist networks, and that technique is applied to model English verb inflection as it developed from the highly complex past tense system of Old English towards that of the modern language, with one predominant ``regular'' inflection and a small number of irregular forms. The model relies on the fact that certain input-output mappings are easier than others to learn in a connectionist network. Highly frequent patterns, or those that share phonological regularities with a number of others, are learned more quickly and with lower error than low-frequency, highly irregular patterns. A network is taught a data set representative of the verb classes of Old English, but learning is stopped before reaching asymptote, and the output of this network is used as the teacher of a new net. As a result, the errors in the first network were passed on to become part of the data set of the second. Those patterns that are hardest to learn led to the most errors, and over time are ``regularized'' to fit a more dominant pattern. The results of the networks simulations were highly consistent with the major historical developments. These results are predicted from well-understood aspects of network dynamics, which therefore provide a rationale for the shape of the attested changes.},

@incollection{harnad02symbolGrounding,
	Abstract = {Many special problems crop up when evolutionary theory turns, quite naturally, to the question of the adaptive value and causal role of consciousness in human and nonhuman organisms. One problem is that -- unless we are to be dualists, treating it as an independent nonphysical force -- consciousness could not have had an independent adaptive function of its own, over and above whatever behavioral and physiological functions it ``supervenes'' on, because evolution is completely blind to the difference between a conscious organism and a functionally equivalent (Turing Indistinguishable) nonconscious ``Zombie'' organism: In other words, the Blind Watchmaker, a functionalist if ever there was one, is no more a mind reader than we are. Hence Turing-Indistinguishability = Darwin-Indistinguishability. It by no means follows from this, however, that human behavior is therefore to be explained only by the push-pull dynamics of Zombie determinism, as dictated by calculations of ``inclusive fitness'' and ``evolutionarily stable strategies.'' We are conscious, and, more important, that consciousness is piggy-backing somehow on the vast complex of unobservable internal activity -- call it ``cognition'' -- that is really responsible for generating all of our behavioral capacities. Hence, except in the palpable presence of the irrational (e.g., our sexual urges) where distal Darwinian factors still have some proximal sway, it is as sensible to seek a Darwinian rather than a cognitive explanation for most of our current behavior as it is to seek a cosmological rather than an engineering explanation of an automobile's behavior. Let evolutionary theory explain what shaped our cognitive capacity (Steklis and Harnad 1976; Harnad 1996, but let cognitive theory explain our resulting behavior.},

@article{harnad90theSymbol,
	Abstract = {There has been much discussion recently about the scope and limits of purely symbolic models of the mind and about the proper role of connectionism in cognitive modeling. This paper describes the ``symbol grounding problem'': How can the semantic interpretation of a formal symbol system be made intrinsic to the system, rather than just parasitic on the meanings in our heads? How can the meanings of the meaningless symbol tokens, manipulated solely on the basis of their (arbitrary) shapes, be grounded in anything but other meaningless symbols? The problem is analogous to trying to learn Chinese from a Chinese/Chinese dictionary alone. A candidate solution is sketched: Symbolic representations must be grounded bottom-up in nonsymbolic representations of two kinds: (1) ``iconic representations'' , which are analogs of the proximal sensory projections of distal objects and events, and (2) ``categorical representations'' , which are learned and innate feature-detectors that pick out the invariant features of object and event categories from their sensory projections. Elementary symbols are the names of these object and event categories, assigned on the basis of their (nonsymbolic) categorical representations. Higher-order (3) ``symbolic representations'' , grounded in these elementary symbols, consist of symbol strings describing category membership relations (e.g., ``An X is a Y that is Z''). <p> Connectionism is one natural candidate for the mechanism that learns the invariant features underlying categorical representations, thereby connecting names to the proximal projections of the distal objects they stand for. In this way connectionism can be seen as a complementary component in a hybrid nonsymbolic/symbolic model of the mind, rather than a rival to purely symbolic modeling. Such a hybrid model would not have an autonomous symbolic ``module,'' however; the symbolic functions would emerge as an intrinsically ``dedicated'' symbol system as a consequence of the bottom-up grounding of categories' names in their sensory representations. Symbol manipulation would be governed not just by the arbitrary shapes of the symbol tokens, but by the nonarbitrary shapes of the icons and category invariants in which they are grounded.},

Language is expressed by words, i.e. strings of symbols, which are generated by agents with their own symbolic grammar system. Agents communicate with each other by deriving and accepting words via rewriting rule set. They are ranked according to their communicative effectiveness: an agent which can derive less frequent and less acceptable words and accept words in less computational time will have higher scores. They can evolve by mutational processes, which change rewriting rules in their symbolic grammars. Complexity and diversity of words increase in the course of time. The emergence of modules and loop structure enhances the evolution. On the other hand, ensemble structure lead to a net-grammar, restricting individual grammars and their evolution.},

@article{hauser07evolutionaryLinguistics,
	Abstract = {This article explores the evolution of language, focusing on insights derived from observations and experiments in animals, guided by current theoretical problems that were inspired by the generative theory of grammar, and carried forward in substantial ways to the present by psycholinguists working on child language acquisition. We suggest that over the past few years, there has been a shift with respect to empirical studies of animals targeting questions of language evolution. In particular, rather than focus exclusively on the ways in which animals communicate, either naturally or by means of artificially acquired symbol systems, more recent work has focused on the underlying computational mechanisms subserving the language faculty and the ability of nonhuman animals to acquire these in some form. This shift in emphasis has brought biologists studying animals in closer contact with linguists studying the formal aspects of language, and has opened the door to a new line of empirical inquiry that we label evolingo. Here we review some of the exciting new findings in the evolingo area, focusing in particular on aspects of semantics and syntax.With respect to semantics, we suggest that some of the apparently distinctive and uniquely linguistic conceptual distinctions may have their origins in nonlinguistic conceptual representations; as one example, we present data on nonhuman primates and their capacity to represent a singular--plural distinction in the absence of language. With respect to syntax, we focus on both statistical and rule-based problems, especially the most recent attempts to explore different layers within the Chomsky hierarchy; here, we discuss work on tamarins and starlings, highlighting differences in the patterns of results as well as differences in methodology that speak to potential issues of learnability. We conclude by highlighting some of the exciting questions that lie ahead, as well as some of the methodological challenges that face both comparative and developmental studies of language evolution.},

	Abstract = {We argue that an understanding of the faculty of language requires substantial interdisciplinary cooperation. We suggest how current developments in linguistics can be pro.tably wedded to work in evolutionary biology, anthropology, psychology, and neuroscience. We submit that a distinction should be made between the faculty of language in the broad sense (FLB)and in the narrow sense (FLN). FLB includes a sensory-motor system, a conceptual-intentional system, and the computational mechanisms for recursion, providing the capacity to generate an in.nite range of expressions from a finite set of elements. We hypothesize that FLN only includes recursion and is the only uniquely human component of the faculty of language. We further argue that FLN may have evolved for reasons other than language, hence comparative studies might look for evidence of such computations outside of the domain of communication (for example, number, navigation, and social relations).},

	Abstract = {We propose a theoretical framework for exploring the evolution of the music faculty from a comparative perspective. This framework addresses questions of phylogeny, adaptive function, innate biases and perceptual mechanisms. We argue that comparative studies can make two unique contributions to investigations of the origins of music. First, musical exposure can be controlled and manipulated to an extent not possible in humans. Second, any features of music perception found in nonhuman animals must not be part of an adaptation for music, and must rather be side effects of more general features of perception or cognition. We review studies that use animal research to target specific aspects of music perception (such as octave generalization), as well as studies that investigate more general and shared systems of the mind/brain that may be relevant to music (such as rhythm perception and emotional encoding). Finally, we suggest several directions for future work, following the lead of comparative studies on the language faculty.},

In fact, agent-based research on this problem anticipates many of the current initiatives of the Semantic Web project. The proposed solution involves developing a domain-specific ontology that can be mapped to other ontologies as required. In this paper we describe an alternative approach which allows autonomous agents to index shared objects without requiring ex-ante agreement on an ontology. Using a process of distributed negotiation, each agent builds a lexicon of the problem-solving competences of other agents. We present an overview of our work using this approach in three domains: a web services scenario, a multi-case-based agent approach and finally, Tagsocratic, a blog-indexing service. We then describe our future work on several open issues related to this research.},

This integration promoted the division of labor among psychologists and anthropologists which persists in many modern studies of mind and culture. This paper presents an alternative model of mind -- the Distributed Cognition model of Mind (DCM) -- based upon a reconstruction of the natures of, and relationships between, culture and cognition. The DCM is founded upon the notions that (1) cognition is built out of interactions among structures, (2) these interactions (instances of processes which employ and create structures) are not limited to events internal to individuals, but distribute across diverse media, social space, and time, and (3) culture is itself such a process, generating many of the structures and processes constituting cognition and human intelligence. The model is supported by data collected during ethnographic fieldwork among fishermen of an island community off the west coast of Sweden. Data analysis demonstrates the negotiated, distributed, and experientially grounded nature of language employed to communicate about sonar images of herring which mediate fishermen's understandings and practice.},

	Abstract = {We present a connectionist model that demonstrates how propositional structure can emerge from the interactions among the members of a community of simple cognitive agents. We first describe a process in which agents coordinating their actions and verbal productions with each other in a shared world leads to the development of propositional structures. We then present a simulation model which implements this process for generating propositions from scratch. We report and discuss the behaviour of the model in terms of its ability to produce three properties of propositions: (1) a coherent lexicon characterised by shared form-meaning mappings; (2) conventional structure in the sequences of forms; (3) the prediction of spatial facts. We show that these properties do not emerge when a single individual learns the task alone and conclude that the properties emerge from the demands of the communication task rather than from anything inside the individual agents. We then show that the shared structural principles can be described as a grammar, and discuss the implications of this demonstration for theories concerning the origins of the structure of language.},

These changes are normally explained by reference to changes in people's internal cognitive processes. We present 2 experiments which provide evidence that changes in the external, collaborative processes that people use to communicate can also affect the structure and organization of symbol systems independently of cognitive change. We propose that mutual-modifiability--opportunities for people to edit or manipulate each other's contributions--is a key constraint on the emergence of complex symbol systems.

Arguably, a minimalist methodology is also a necessary component in any explanatory approach to language evolution, no matter its theoretical orientation.

@article{holman96quantitative,
	Abstract = {Statistical analyses of a published phylogenetic classification of languages show some properties attributable to taxonomic methods and others that reflect the nature of linguistic evolution. The inferred phylogenetic tree is less well resolved and more asymmetric at the highest taxonomic ranks, where the tree is constructed mainly by phenetic methods. At lower ranks, where cladistic methods are more prevalent, the asymmetry of well resolved parts of the tree is consistent with a stochastic birth and death process in which languages originate and become extinct at constant rates, although poorly resolved parts of the tree are still more asymmetric than predicted. Other tests applied to a sample of historically recorded languages reveal substantial fluctuations in the rates of origination and extinction, with both rates temporarily reduced when languages enter the historical record. For languages in general, the average origination rate is estimated to be only slightly higher than the average extinction rate, which in turn corresponds to an average lifetime of about 500 years or less.},

To evaluate this population fissions mechanism, we collected published mtDNA sequences for 1,381 individuals from 17 Native Central and South American populations. We then tested the hypothesis that three well-known language classifications also represented the genetic structure of these populations. We rejected the hypothesis for each language classification. Our tests revealed linguistic and genetic correspondence in several shallow branches common to each classification, but no linguistic and genetic correspondence in the deeper branches contained in two of the language classifications. We discuss the possible causes for the lack of congruence between linguistic and genetic structure in the region, and describe alternative mechanisms of linguistic and genetic correspondence and their predictions.},

@phdthesis{hurd97phd,
	Abstract = {This thesis investigates communication between animals with conflicting interests. Particular attention is paid to conventional signalling, in which signals are not inherently costly and information is inferred by convention. This type of signalling is emphasised for two reasons: firstly it is communication in its purest sense, and secondly it seems to more accurately reflect the properties of many biological signals. The costs which maintain the evolutionary stability of communication are of great interest because of the apparent benefit to be gained through the use of misleading signals, such as bluffs. I argue that these stabilising costs emerge from the manner in which receivers respond to signals, rather than being inherent to the signals themselves. <p> The theoretical papers in this thesis begin with the most basic signalling game and proceed towards a more general understanding of conventional signalling. I begin by investigating the importance of signal cost in the simplest possible model of communication, the Action-Response game. I demonstrate that the signals used do not have to be costly to be reliable, even when the signaller and receiver are in a state of conflict. I then consider the effect of adding costs to signals in a game in which reliable conventional signalling already exists, and demonstrate that the costly signals will be used by the weaker, not stronger, signallers. This demonstrates a stabilising mechanism fundamentally different from that of the handicap hypothesis, with its stabilisation through signal cost. Finally, I identify the conditions other than cost which are necessary for conventional signalling to be evolutionarily stable. These conditions relate to the information which both signaller and receiver must gain over the course of an interaction. Most models used to investigate signalling cannot account for behaviour seen in more complicated biological interactions because they are too simple to produce results other than that of the handicap prediction. <p> The other work included in this thesis addresses issues raised by the models. I review the literature on threat display use by birds, and present evidence that these displays are conventional signals. The stability of conventional signalling rests upon the existence of some common interest within a larger conflict between signaller and receiver. I present a clear example of communication attributable to common interest between fighting opponents. Cichlids of the species Nannacara anomala use a distinct colour signal, the Medial Line display, to coordinate another agonistic behaviour, tail-beating. It appears that both individuals benefit from the clearer assessment of relative fighting ability that this coordination affords. These N. anomala colour displays are quite conspicuous. It has been assumed that when common interest exists, signals will be very subtle, whereas when signaller and receiver are in conflict, signals will be exaggerated and conspicuous. Using an evolving neural-network model, I demonstrate that selection for exaggerated signals may exist even when the signaller and receiver have complete common interests.},

The reason for this is that individuals of higher fighting ability have less to gain by avoiding escalated contests, and are thus more sensitive to signal costs. These results are of particular relevance to badges of status and other simultaneous signals used to settle contests over minor resources},

I explore the conditions on the magnitude of the stabilizing cost and handicap that must hold in order to maintain the evolutionary stability of signalling.

@article{hurford05nounPhrases,
	Abstract = {This paper argues for an alternative answer to Carstairs-McCarthy's (1999) question ``Why do all languages distinguish between NPs and sentences?'' While agreeing on basic philosophical points with Carstairs-McCarthy, such as the lack of a distinction between truth and reference independent of grammar, I argue that the S/NP distinction has its roots in the basic communicative distinction between Topic and Comment. In the very earliest mental processes, long antedating language, binary structure can be found, with components that one can associate with the functions of identifying or locating an object and representing some information about it. When private thought went public, the earliest messages in any code with rudimentary syntax were of similar bipartite structure, with one part conveying information presumed to be already known to the hearer, and identifying the object that the message is about. The other part of the bipartite message conveyed information presumed to be new to the hearer. This bipartite structure, with its concomitant distinction between types of expression that could fulfil the respective roles, was central enough to the main function of public language, namely communication, that it was never eroded away, and is the basis of the bipartite structure found universally in languages today.},

@article{hurford06packingStrategy,
	Abstract = {A strong constraint on the arithmetical combinations allowed in compound numerals, called the Packing Strategy, applies very widely to numeral systems across the world. A previous attempt to explain the existence of the strong universal constraint, in terms of a gradual socio-historical process of standardization, will not scale up to higher-valued numerals. It is proposed that the real explanation for the Packing Strategy is that it reflects two natural principles applied in the practical task of counting objects. These two principles, `Go as far as you can with the resources you have', and `Minimize the number of entities you are dealing with', are not specific to the counting task, but are of more general application to practical tasks.},

@inproceedings{hurford06ProtoProposition,
	Abstract = {Before the evolution of languages as public conventional communication systems, pre-humans had somewhat complex private mental schemes for representing the external world. What is known about human and some animal vision suggests that proposition-like cognitive structures existed for the mental representation of perceived scenes before the advent of complex language. The structures traditionally adopted by formal Logic can be modified to conform to known constraints on the visual representation of scenes. While this modification slightly reduces the expressive power of representations (in that the meanings of some complex sentences cannot naturally be represented), it provides a unified, ontologically parsimonious, primitive notation for cognitive representations, suitable for later recruitment by complex syntactic language. The most basic semantic elements later mapped onto sentences are all present in the prelinguistic mental representation, which reflects the workings of the visual attention system},

@article{hurford06recentDevelopmentsEvoLang,
	Abstract = {The last quarter of the 20th century saw a surge in research in the evolution of language, and this activity continues to grow and extend its influence in the present century. This article is a personal review of some conclusions that can be deemed to have been established in that period. Many of these modern conclusions had ancient precursors as speculative hypotheses with little empirical backing. Modern empirical research in a range of fields has driven foundations deeper, and careful theoretical work has begun to weave a more consistent network of ideas across disciplines. Many mysteries remain, but some clear outlines of the evolutionary bases of humans? most distinctive capacity have begun to emerge. Often the clearer outlines have revealed more complex problems than was vaguely suspected earlier. Three propositions have been selected here, and each will be briefly discussed in a separate section. The three propositions are: 'Language' is not a single monolithic behaviour; Animals have rich conceptual systems; Primates are not necessarily the closest to human-like capacities.},

@article{hurford04humanUniqueness,
	Abstract = {Human language is qualitatively different from animal communication systems in at least two separate ways. Human languages contain tens of thousands of arbitrary learned symbols (mainly words). No other animal communication system involves learning the component symbolic elements afresh in each individual's lifetime, and certainly not in such vast numbers. Human language also has complex compositional syntax. The meanings of our sentences are composed from the meanings of the constituent parts (e.g. the words). This is obvious to us, but no other animal communication system (with honeybees as an odd but distracting exception) puts messages together in this way. A recent theoretical claim that the sole distinguishing feature of human language is recursion is discussed, and related to these features of learned symbols and compositional syntax. It is argued that recursive thought could have existed in prelinguistic hominids, and that the key step to language was the innovative disposition to learn massive numbers of arbitrary symbols},

Innate dispositions to synonymy and homonymy are modelled here, in relation to alternative roles of speaking and hearing in determining fitness. <p> In the computer model, linguistic signs are acquired via different genetically determined strategies, variously (in)tolerant to synonymy or homonymy. The model defines communicative success as the probability of a speaker getting a message across to a hearer; interpretive success is the probability of a hearer correctly interpreting a speaker's signal. Communicative and interpretive success are compared as bases for reproductive fitness. When communicative success is the basis for fitness, a genotype evolves which is averse to synonymy, while tolerating homonymy. Conversely, when interpretive success is the basis for fitness, a genotype evolves which is averse to homonymy, while tolerating synonymy.},

@article{hurford01randomBoolean,
	Abstract = {Describes an attempt to cast several abstract properties of natural languages in the framework of Kauffman's (1993, 1995) random Boolean nets (RBN). The properties are complexity, interconnectedness, stability, diversity, and underdeterminedness. A language is modeled as a Boolean net attractor. (Groups of) net nodes are linguistic principles or parameters as posited by Chomskyan theory, according to which the language learner sets parameters to appropriate values on the basis of very limited experience of the language. The setting of one parameter can have a complex effect on the settings of others. A RBN is generated to find an attractor. A state from this attractor is degraded, which represents the degenerate input of language to the learner, and this state is then input to a net with the same connectivity and activation functions as the original net to see whether it converges on the same attractor. Many nets degenerate into attractors representing complete uncertainty. Others settle at intermediate levels of uncertainty, and some manage to overcome the incompleteness of input and converge on attractors identical to that from which the original inputs were (de)generated. Finally, an attempt was made to select a population of such successful nets, using a genetic algorithm where fitness was correlated with an ability to acquire several different languages faithfully. This has so far proved impossible, supporting the Chomskyan suggestion that the human language acquisition capacity is not the outcome of natural selection.},

@article{hurford91theEvolution,
	Abstract = {Evidence suggests that there is a critical, or at least a sensitive, period for language acquisition, which ends around puberty. The existence of this period is explained by an evolutionary model which assumes that (a) linguistic ability is in principle (if not in practice) measurable, and (b) the amount of language controlled by an individual conferred selective advantage on it. In this model, the language faculty is seen as adaptive, favoured by natural selection, while the critical period for language acquisition itself is not an adaptation, but arises from the interplay of genetic factors influencing life-history characters in relation to language acquisition. The evolutionary model is implemented on a computer and simulations of populations evolving under various plausible, if idealized, conditions result in clear critical period effects, which end around puberty.},

@article{hurford89biologicalEvolution,
	Abstract = {Most linguistic theories assume lexicon entries which incorporate the idea of the Saussurean sign, a bidirectional mapping between a phonological form and some representation of a concept. This Sign, like grammars generally, is unbiased with respect to perception or production, and provides part of the cognitive map which speakers use both in speaking and in interpreting the utterances of others. This bidirectionality of the Sign, or code, is a design feature of human language although workable communication does not necessarily incorporate such a feature. <p> Part of the Language Acquisition Device is a mechanism which mentally constructs such a bidirectional mapping, on the basis of observed samples of communicative behaviour (transmission and reception). This basic aspect of the LAD presumably evolved because of its superiority over other conceivable mechanisms for acquiring a basis for communicative behaviour from a sampling of observed transmission and reception data. <p> Three conceivable strategies for acquiring the basis of communicative behaviour, here labelled the Imitator, Calculator, and Saussurean strategies, are defined as functions from samplings of observed behaviour to acquired behaviour patterns. Essentially, the Imitator imitates the transmission and reception patterns in the observed sample; the Calculator constructs optimal reception responses to the transmissions in the observed sample and optimal transmission responses to receptions in the observed sample; the Saussurean imitates the transmission behaviour in the sample, but shapes his reception behaviour to mirror the acquired transmission behaviour, thus internalizing the equivalent of a set of bidirectional Saussurean signs. Extensive simulations of populations endowed with these innate strategies show the Saussurean strategy to be a winner in evolutionary terms; it produces individuals who communicate more successfully than individuals endowed with the other two strategies.},

	Abstract = {In this paper, we elaborate upon the framework by considering more explicitly the problem of creating shared symbolic structure. A lexicon is (among other things) a set of public structures for denoting or implicating shared meanings. In other words, the existence of a lexicon requires the sharing of forms and meanings -- and mappings between these -- among members of an interacting population of agents. Leaving aside cosmic and theological events which could create such an outcome, how could a lexicon come to be? The solution provided here is based upon a convergence of agents' schemes for classifying visual phenomena. All agents have a capacity for such classification, but convergence upon a singular scheme is shaped by the constraints for consensus when employing the scheme in interaction with other agents.},

The general idea is to simulate a world in which learning agents create external structures which mediate their behavior. This simulation demonstrates the simple (but very important) concept that such a system is capable, through generations of time, of producing agents endowed with cognitive powers that are not attainable in the lifetime of any individual agent. We argue that such an outcome is possible without effecting the genetic organization of individuals. However, we also argue that the cultural process is capable of guiding both learning and phylogenetic evolution, which leaves open the possiblity of genetic organization tracking cultural process.},

@inproceedings{iwahashi06robotsEELC,
	Abstract = {This paper describes a machine learning method that enables robots to learn the capability of linguistic communication from scratch through verbal and nonverbal interaction with users. The method focuses on two major problems that should be pursued to realize natural human-machine conversation: a scalable grounded symbol system and belief sharing. The learning is performed in the process of joint perception and joint action with a user. The method enables the robot to learn beliefs for communication by combining speech, visual, and behavioral reinforcement information in a probabilistic framework. The beliefs learned include speech units like phonemes or syllables, a lexicon, grammar, and pragmatic knowledge, and they are integrated in a system represented by a dynamical graphical model. The method also enables the user and the robot to infer the state of each other's beliefs related to communication. To facilitate such inference, the belief system held by the robot possesses a structure that represents the assumption of shared beliefs and allows for fast and robust adaptation of it through communication with the user. This adaptive behavior of the belief systems is modeled by the structural coupling of the belief systems held by the robot and the user, and it is performed through incremental online optimization in the process of interaction. Experimental results reveal that through a practical, small number of learning episodes with a user, the robot was eventually able to understand even fragmental and ambiguous utterances, act upon them, and generate utterances appropriate for the given situation. This work discusses the importance of properly handling the risk of being misunderstood in order to facilitate mutual understanding and to keep the coupling effective.},

Bickerton's proposed `protolanguage' falls somewhere in the middle of this succession. In addition to the by-now accepted evidence from language learning, language disorders, and ape language experiments, modern languages provide evidence of these stages of evolution through the presence of detectable `fossils' in vocabulary and grammar.},

@article{jackendoff_pinker05ReplytoFitchHauserChomsky52,
	Abstract = {In a continuation of the conversation with Fitch, Chomsky, and Hauser on the evolution of language, we examine their defense of the claim that the uniquely human, language-specific part of the language faculty (the ``narrow language faculty'') consists only of recursion, and that this part cannot be considered an adaptation to communication. We argue that their characterization of the narrow language faculty is problematic for many reasons, including its dichotomization of cognitive capacities into those that are utterly unique and those that are identical to nonlinguistic or nonhuman capacities, omitting capacities that may have been substantially modified during human evolution. We also question their dichotomy of the current utility versus original function of a trait, which omits traits that are adaptations for current use, and their dichotomy of humans and animals, which conflates similarity due to common function and similarity due to inheritance from a recent common ancestor. We show that recursion, though absent from other animals' communications systems, is found in visual cognition, hence cannot be the sole evolutionary development that granted language to humans. Finally, we note that despite Fitch et al.'s denial, their view of language evolution is tied to Chomsky's conception of language itself, which identifies combinatorial productivity with a core of ``narrow syntax.'' An alternative conception, in which combinatoriality is spread across words and constructions, has both empirical advantages and greater evolutionary plausibility.},

In the first part, we explore the conceptual issues that arise. In the second part of the paper, we focus on the explanatory potential of horizontal evolution. We particularly focus on two case studies, concerning Zipf's Law and universal properties of color terms, respectively. We show how computer simulations can be employed to study the large scale, emergent, consequences of psychologically and psychologically motivated assumptions about the working of horizontal language transmission.},

The purpose of the game is to distinguish between uncoordinated and coordinated self-sacrifice. In a test of four signaling conditions with players who belong to a culturally homogeneous population, a 'cheap talk' condition led to efficient coordination, whereas signaling opportunities engaging social reputation and allowing eye-contact without speech yielded poorly coordinated altruistic behavior. The implications are: (1) without language, mere willingness to cooperate on a social dilemma is insufficient for coordinating intentions, and (2) given a sufficiently cohesive social group, language can coordinate inequitable, altruistic sacrifices of modest but real material incentives, even where fully anonymous defection is an option.},

A method is proposed to overcome the difficulties of evolving separate yet compatible parts required by transmitters and receivers that serve no function but communication. The validity of this method is supported by a series of experiments. These not only succeed in evolving agents capable of controlling and enhancing complex behaviours through signaling but also demonstrate how bigger search spaces with more signal channels than might be needed can lead to faster adaptation.},

Using semantic density, a simple rule is presented that provides a pessimistic estimate of the minimum language size that should be used for any multi-agent problem in which the agents communicate simultaneously.

A genetic algorithm is used to evolve multi-agent languages for the predator agents in a version of the predator-prey pursuit problem. We show that the resulting behavior of the communicating multi-agent system is equivalent to that of a Mealy finite state machine whose states are determined by the agents' usage of the evolved language. Simulations show that the evolution of a communication language improves the performance of the predators. Increasing the language size (and thus increasing the number of possible states in the Mealy machine) improves the performance even further. Furthermore, the evolved communicating predators perform significantly better than all previous work on similar prey. We introduce a method for incrementally increasing the language size, which results in an effective coarse-to-fine search that significantly reduces the evolution time required to find a solution. We present some observations on the effects of language size, experimental setup, and prey difficulty on the evolved Mealy machines. In particular, we observe that the start state is often revisited, and incrementally increasing the language size results in smaller Mealy machines. Finally, a simple rule is derived that provides a pessimistic estimate on the minimum language size that should be used for any multi-agent problem.},

@article{juergens06languageEvolver,
	Abstract = {Since many domains are constantly evolving, the associated domain specific languages (DSL) inevitably have to evolve too, to retain their value. But the evolution of a DSL can be very expensive, since existing words of the language (i.e. programs) and tools have to be adapted according to the changes of the DSL itself. In such cases, these costs seriously limit the adoption of DSLs. This paper presents Lever, a tool for the evolutionary development of DSLs. Lever aims at making evolutionary changes to a DSL much cheaper by automating the adaptation of the DSL parser as well as existing words and providing additional support for the correct adaptation of existing tools (e.g. program generators). This way, Lever simplifies DSL maintenance and paves the ground for bottom-up DSL development.},

It is shown that this measurement is intuitively plausible and that meaningful measurements can be made from as few as 1000 characters. This measurement technique is extended to the task of determining the ``rate'' of language change based on an examination of brief excerpts from the National Geographic Magazine and determining both their linguistic distance from one another as well as the number of years of temporal separation. A statistical analysis of these results shows, first, that language change can be measured, and second, that the rate of language change has not been uniform, and that in particular, the period 1939--1948 had particularly slow change, while 1949--1958 and 1959--1968 had particularly rapid changes.},

For several learning tasks occurring within a Multi-Agent System, communication activities are investigated and the need for a mutual understanding of agents participating in the learning process is made explicit. Thus, the need for a common ontology to exchange learning-related information is shown. Building this ontology is an additional learning task that is not only extremely important, but also extremely difficult. We propose a solution that is motivated by the human ability to understand each other even in the absence of a common language by using alternative communication channels, such as gestures.},

It is known that when the agents are arranged in a two-dimensional lattice structure and interact by diffusion and encounter, then their final vocabulary size is the maximum possible. Knowing all available words is essential in order to increase the probability to 'survive' by effective reproduction. On scale-free networks we find a different result. It is not necessary to learn the entire vocabulary available. Survival chances are increased by using the vocabulary of the 'hubs' (nodes with high degree). The existence of the 'hubs' in a scale-free network is the source of an additional important fitness generating mechanism. (C) 2007 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.},

The prevalence of this process of {\^a}{\oe}iterated learning{\^a} as a mode of cultural transmission raises the question of how it affects the information being transmitted. Analyses of iterated learning under the assumption that the learners are Bayesian agents predict that this process should converge to an equilibrium that reflects the inductive biases of the learners.

@inproceedings{kanj06evolutionReconstructing,
	Abstract = {In a recent article, Nakhleh, Ringe and Warnow introduced perfect phylogenetic networks --a model of language evolution where languages do not evolve via clean speciation-- and formulated a set of problems for their accurate reconstruction. Their new methodology assumes networks, rather than trees, as the correct model to capture the evolutionary history of natural languages. They proved the NP-hardness of the problem of testing whether a network is a perfect phy- logenetic one for characters exhibiting at least three states, leaving open the case of binary characters, and gave a straightforward brute-force parameterized algorithm for the problem of running time O(3k n), where k is the number of bidirectional edges in the network and n is its size. In this paper, we first establish the NP-hardness of the binary case of the problem. Then we provide a more efficient parameterized algorithm for this case running in time O(2k n 2). The presented algorithm is very simple, and utilizes some structural results and elegant operations developed in this paper that can be useful on their own in the design of heuristic algorithms for the problem. The analysis phase of the algorithm is very elegant using amortized techniques to show that the upper bound on the running time of the algorithm is much tighter than the upper bound obtained under a conservative worst-case scenario assumption. Our results bear significant impact on reconstructing evolutionary histories of languages --particularly from phonological and morphological character data, most of which exhibit at most two states (i.e., are binary), as well as on the design and analysis of parameterized algorithms.},

@article{Kaplan05distributedCoordination,
	Abstract = {Distributed co-ordination is the result of dynamical processes enabling independent agents to co-ordinate their actions without the need of a central co-ordinator. In the past few years, several computational models have illustrated the role played by such dynamics for self-organizing communication systems. In particular, it has been shown that agents could bootstrap shared convention systems based on simple local adaptation rules. Such models have played a pivotal role for our understanding of emergent language processes. However, only few formal or theoretical results have been published about such systems. Deliberately simple computational models are discussed in this paper in order to make progress in understanding the underlying dynamics responsible for distributed co-ordination and the scaling laws of such systems. In particular, the paper focuses on explaining the convergence speed of those models, a largely under-investigated issue. Conjectures obtained through empirical and qualitative studies of these simple models are compared with results of more complex simulations and discussed in relation to theoretical models formalized using Markov chains, game theory and Polya processes.},

@article{kay98theHypoglossal,
	Abstract = {The mammalian hypoglossal canal transmits the nerve that supplies the muscles of the tongue. This canal is absolutely and relatively larger in modern humans than it is in the African apes (Pan and Gorilla). We hypothesize that the human tongue is supplied more richly with motor nerves than are those of living apes and propose that canal size in fossil hominids may provide an indication about the motor coordination of the tongue and reflect the evolution of speech and language. Canals of gracile Australopithecus, and possibly Homo habilis, fall within the range of extant Pan and are significantly smaller than those of modern Homo. The canals of Neanderthals and an early ``modern'' Homo sapiens (Skhul 5), as well as of African and European middle Pleistocene Homo (Kabwe and Swanscombe), fall within the range of extant Homo and are significantly larger than those of Pan troglodytes. These anatomical findings suggest that the vocal capabilities of Neanderthals were the same as those of humans today. Furthermore, the vocal abilities of Australopithecus were not advanced significantly over those of chimpanzees whereas those of Homo may have been essentially modern by at least 400,000 years ago. Thus, human vocal abilities may have appeared much earlier in time than the first archaeological evidence for symbolic behavior},

@unpublished{ke07complexNetworkLanguage,
	Abstract = {This paper introduces how human languages can be studied in light of recent development of network theories. There are two directions of exploration. One is to study networks existing in the language system. Various lexical networks can be built based on different relationships between words, being semantic or syntactic. Recent studies have shown that these lexical networks exhibit small-world and scale-free features. The other direction of exploration is to study networks of language users (i.e. social networks of people in the linguistic community), and their role in language evolution. Social networks also show small-world and scale-free features, which cannot be captured by random or regular network models. In the past, computational models of language change and language emergence often assume a population to have a random or regular structure, and there has been little discussion how network structures may affect the dynamics. In the second part of the paper, a series of simulation models of diffusion of linguistic innovation are used to illustrate the importance of choosing realistic conditions of population structure for modeling language change. Four types of social networks are compared, which exhibit two categories of diffusion dynamics. While the questions about which type of networks are more appropriate for modeling still remains, we give some preliminary suggestions for choosing the type of social networks for modeling.},

@phdthesis{ke04phd,
	Abstract = {This thesis proposes a framework adopting the self-organization theory for the study of language evolution. Self-organization explains collective behaviors and evolution with the observation that the patterns at the global level in a complex system are often properties spontaneously emergent from the numerous local interactions among the individual components, and they cannot be understood by only examining the individual components. <p> Language can be viewed as such emergent properties instead of products from some innate blueprint in humans. We highlight the importance of recognizing language at two distinctive but inter-dependent levels of existence, i.e. in the idiolect and in the communal language, and a self-organizing process existing at each of the two levels. It is necessary to clarify what phenomena are properties of the idiolects, and what properties are the collective behaviors at the population level. <p> In linguistics, however, very often an abstract language system is taken as the object of analysis. This level of analysis disregards the distinction between idiolect and communal language, and neglects the heterogeneous nature of language at both levels. As a consequence, explanations for observed patterns based on this abstract level of analysis are often inadequate. However, this is a necessary step for linguists to identify interesting phenomena in the first place. At this abstract level of analysis, the self-organization framework can also be applied. It is assumed that the abstract language system self-organizes. A study on homophony in languages is taken as an example to illustrate the analysis at this level. It is shown that the existence of homophony reflects several self-organization characteristics in a dynamic process of language evolution, such as the predictable degree of homophony, the disyllabification in Chinese dialects, the differentiation of homophone pairs in grammatical class. <p> We are further interested in how the self-organization is implemented. To answer this question, we need to look into the idiolects in this self-organizing process, to know how the idiolects are formed and affect each other. Language change provides an informative window in addressing these issues. Language change is the result of the collective behaviors of idiolects, even as it affects the idiolects. The heterogeneity among idiolects is exposed to the greatest extent in on-going changes. <p> An on-going sound change in Cantonese is taken as a case study to scrutinize the heterogeneity in the self-organizing processes. The fieldwork data reveal a large degree of variation both in the population (VT-I) and in the set of words (VT-II). Another type of variation (VT-III) is highlighted, that is, a word may also show variation within one single speaker. But this VT-III within speakers only exists in a proportion, but not all, of the words subject to the change. Also we find that if a speaker has some words consistently in the unchanged state and some words in the changed state, then this speaker must have some other words in the variation state. Most speakers show the existence of VT-III, but they vary in degree. The observed individual differences in the degree of VT-III suggest that the large heterogeneity may be not only accounted for by the variability of linguistic input, but also by individuals' different learning styles. We hypothesize two types of lexical learning styles, i.e. probabilistic and categorical learning. These differences in learning styles suggest that when we examine the agent's internal properties in the self-organization framework, it is not only necessary to examine the commonalities among agents, but also the differences among them. <p> In addition to empirical studies, this thesis employs computational modeling as a major tool for investigation, as modeling provides effective ways to test hypotheses beyond empirical studies, and suggests new questions. After a brief review of the modeling studies in the field, some models developed in this thesis for language origin and language change are reported. <p> The first model is to simulate the emergence of a consistent vocabulary from a set of random mappings between meanings and forms. It emphasizes the importance of implementing the actual process of interaction among agents, and the cumulative effect on agents' linguistic behaviors. The model suggests that the Saussurean sign with identical speaking and listening mappings may not be a biological predisposition from natural selection, but rather a result from the process of language learning and use. The process exhibits a phase transition from a long period of small oscillation to an abrupt convergence. Such phase transition is often observed in self-organizing systems. <p> The second model simulates language change as innovation diffusion, and examines the effects of various factors, including some concerning properties of agents and some affecting agents' interactions. By comparing the outcome under different conditions, the model illustrates the importance of incorporating realistic assumptions, such as finite population size, age-dependent propensity to change, different learning environment in a social network, etc. The model compares the dynamics of language change in different types of network structures and shows that in non-regular networks, the rate of innovation diffusion increases little as population size increases. The model also tests the effect of the two types of hypothesized learning styles, and shows that in a population with the presence of probabilistic learners, an innovation with a small advantage will easily spread into the population and lead to a change. This may explain why language changes are so frequent. <p> This thesis demonstrates that both empirical and modeling studies on language evolution can greatly benefit from adopting a self-organization framework. The convergence and interplay of the two lines of exploration, i.e. biological bases in agents and the long term effect of interactions among them, should bring us a deeper understanding of how language has evolved and is evolving.},

@article{ke08languageAndSocialNetwork,
	Abstract = {Social networks play an important role in determining the dynamics and outcome of language change. Early empirical studies only examine small-scale local social networks, and focus on the relationship between the individual speakers' linguistic behaviors and their characteristics in the network. In contrast, computer models can provide an efficient tool to consider large-scale networks with different structures and discuss the long-term effect of individuals' learning and interaction on language change. This paper presents an agent-based computer model which simulates language change as a process of innovation diffusion, to address the threshold problem of language change. In the model, the population is implemented as a network of agents with age differences and different learning abilities, and the population is changing, with new agents born periodically to replace old ones. Four typical types of networks and their effect on the diffusion dynamics are examined. When the functional bias is sufficiently high, innovations always diffuse to the whole population in a linear manner in regular and small-world networks, but diffuse quickly in a sharp S-curve in random and scale-free networks. The success rate of diffusion is higher in regular and small-world networks than in random and scale-free networks. In addition, the model shows that as long as the population contains a small number of statistical learners who can learn and use both linguistic variants statistically according to the impact of these variants in the input, there is a very high probability for linguistic innovations with only small functional advantage to overcome the threshold of diffusion.},

@article{ke02complexity,
	Abstract = {Human language may have started from a consistent set of mappings between meanings and signals. These mappings, referred to as the early vocabulary, are considered to be the results of conventions established among the agents of a population. In this study, we report simulation models for investigating how such conventions can be reached. We propose that convention is essentially the product of self-organization of the population through interactions among the agents; and that cultural selection is another mechanism that speeds up the establishment of convention. Whereas earlier studies emphasized either one or the other of these two mechanisms, our focus is to integrate them into one hybrid model. The combination of these two complementary mechanisms, i.e. self-organization and cultural selection, provides a plausible explanation for cultural evolution which progresses with high transmission rate. Furthermore, we observe that as the vocabulary tends to convergence there is a uniform tendency to exhibit a sharp phase transition.},

@article{ke_GAModelSound,
	Abstract = {In this study, optimization models using Genetic Algorithms are proposed to study the conguration of vowels and tone systems. Similar to previous explanatory models that have been used to study vowel systems, certain criteria, which are assumed to be the principles governing the structure of sound systems, are used to predict optimal vowels and tone systems. In most of the earlier studies only one criterion has been considered. When two criteria are considered, they are often combined into one scalar function. The GA model proposed for the study of tone systems uses a Pareto-ranking method which is highly applicable for dealing with optimization problems having multiple criteria. For optimization of tone systems, perceptual contrast and markedness complexity are considered simultaneously. Although the consistency between the predicted systems and the observed systems is not as significant as those obtained for vowel systems, further investigation along this line is promising.},

@unpublished{ke06languageDevelopmentNetwork,
	Abstract = {In this paper we propose some new measures of language development using network analyses, which is inspired by the recent surge of interests in network studies of many real-world systems. Children's and care-takers' speech data from a longitudinal study are represented as a series of networks, word forms being taken as nodes and collocation of words as links. Measures on the properties of the networks, such as size, connectivity, hub and authority analyses, etc., allow us to make quantitative comparison so as to reveal different paths of development. For example, the asynchrony of development in network size and average degree suggests that children cannot be simply classified as early talkers or late talkers by one or two measures. Children follow different paths in a multi-dimensional space. They may develop faster in one dimension but slower in another dimension. The network approach requires little preprocessing of words and analyses on sentence structures, and the characteristics of words and their usage emerge from the network and are independent of any grammatical presumptions. We show that the change of the two articles 'the' and 'a' in their roles as important nodes in the network reflects the progress of children's syntactic development: the two articles often start in children's networks as hubs and later shift to authorities, while they are authorities constantly in the adult's networks. The network analyses provide a new approach to study language development, and at the same time language development also presents a rich area for network theories to explore.},

This process of iterated learning has been explored extensively in recent years using computational and mathematical models. These models have shown how compositional syntax provides language with a stability advantage and that iterated learning can induce linguistic adaptation. This paper presents an extension to previous idealised models to allow linguistic agents flexibility and choice in how they construct the semantics of linguistic expressions. This extension allows us to examine the complete dynamics of mixed compositional and holistic languages, look at how semantics can evolve culturally, and how communicative contexts impact on the evolution of meaning structure.},

A survey of the models that have been developed over the last decade and a half is presented to demonstrate that ALife techniques have a lot to offer an explanatory theory of language. It is argued that this is because much of the structure of language is determined by the interaction of three complex adaptive systems: learning, culture and biological evolution. Computational simulation, informed by theoretical linguistics, is an appropriate response to the challenge of explaining real linguistic data in terms of the processes that underpin human language.},

	Abstract = {A computationally implemented model of the transmission of linguistic behavior over time is presented. In this iterated learning model (ILM), there is no biological evolution, natural selection, nor any measurement of the success of the agents at communicating (except for results-gathering purposes). Nevertheless, counter to intuition, significant evolution of linguistic behavior is observed. From an initially unstructured communication system (a protolanguage), a fully compositional syntactic meaning-string mapping emerges. Furthermore, given a nonuniform frequency distribution over a meaning space and a production mechanism that prefers short strings, a realistic distribution of string lengths and patterns of stable irregularity emerges, suggesting that the ILM is a good model for the evolution of some of the fundamental features of human language.},

@phdthesis{kirby99functionSelection,
	Abstract = {A central topic for linguistic theory is the degree to which the communicative function of language influences its form. In particular many so-called functional explanations argue that cross-linguistic constraints can be explained with reference to pressures imposed by processing. In apparent opposition to this is the innatist stance which claims that universals are properties imposed by an autonomous language module. This thesis approaches the issues raised by this conflict by examining the nature of the link between processing and universals. The starting point for the work, then, is not the discovery of new universals nor new explanations, but the question ``exactly how do processing theories that have been proposed give rise to the universals that they claim to explain?'' Careful investigation of this problem proves to be fruitful in highlighting the roles of innateness and function in explaining universals. <p> The methodology chosen involves computational simulations of language as a complex adaptive system, in which language universals appear as emergent properties of the dynamics of the system and the influence of processing on use. This influence is characterised as a differential selection of competing variant forms. The simulation approach is first used to demonstrate the plausibility of a recent parsing explanation for word order universals. An extension of the model to deal with hierarchical universals relating to relative clauses leads to the conclusion that current explanations of hierarchies in general are incomplete. Instead, it is argued that implicational hierarchies are the result of competing processing pressures, in particular between morphological and parsing complexity. <p> Further examination of relative clause processing and universals leads to an apparent flaw in the approach put forward. It is noted that not all processing pressures appear to show up as universals, challenging the explanatory adequacy of the functional explanations. Instead, it is shown that a complete characterisation of language as an adaptive system requires there to be an innate, autonomous syntactic component to language. This leads to the conclusion that universals arise from the interaction of processing constraints and constraints imposed on the adaptive process by an innate language acquisition device. Moreover, the possibility of processing directly influencing this innate faculty without violating its autonomy is investigated with reference to recent work on the biological evolution of language. <p> This thesis therefore espouses a perspective on the explanation of language universals in which processing complexity and autonomous syntactic constraints have crucial and complementary roles.},

	Abstract = {Human language arises from biological evolution, individual learning, and cultural transmission, but the interaction of these three processes has not been widely studied. We set out a formal framework for analyzing cultural transmission, which allows us to investigate how innate learning biases are related to universal properties of language. We show that cultural transmission can magnify weak biases into strong linguistic universals, undermining one of the arguments for strong innate constraints on language learning. As a consequence, the strength of innate biases can be shielded from natural selection, allowing these genes to drift. Furthermore, even when there is no natural selection, cultural transmission can produce apparent adaptations. Cultural transmission thus provides an alternative to traditional nativist and adaptationist explanations for the properties of human languages.},

Parsimonious and general characterizations of linguistic variation are assumed to uncover features of UG. This paper reviews a recently developed evolutionary approach to language that casts doubt on this assumption: the Iterated Learning Model (ILM). We treat UG as a model of our prior learning bias, and consider how languages may adapt in response to this bias. By dealing directly with populations of linguistic agents, the ILM allows us to study the adaptive landscape that particular learning biases result in. The key result from this work is that the relationship between UG and language structure is non-trivial.},

Following the basic ideas in Solomonoff's theory of inductive inference and Rissanen's MDL framework, the learning is formulated as a process of inferring regularities, in the form of string patterns (i.e., words), from a given set of data. A segmentation algorithm is designed to segment each input utterance into a sequence of word candidates giving an optimal sum of description length gain (DLG). The learning model has a lexical refinement module to exploit this algorithm to derive finer-grained word candidates recursively until no more compression effect is available. Experimental results on an infant-directed speech corpus show that this approach reaches a state-of-art performance in terms of precision and recall of both words and word boundaries},

RGGs can be seen as an extension of the well-known parametric Lindenmayer systems and contain rule-based, procedural, and object-oriented features. They are defined as rewriting systems operating on graphs with the edges coming from a set of user-defined relations, whereas the nodes can be associated with objects. We demonstrate their ability to represent genes, regulatory networks of metabolites, and morphologically structured organisms, as well as developmental aspects of these entities, in a common formal framework. Mutation, crossing over, selection, and the dynamics of a network of gene regulation can all be represented with simple graph rewriting rules. This is demonstrated in some detail on the classical example of Dawkins' biomorphs and the ABC model of flower morphogenesis: other applications are briefly sketched. An interactive program was implemented, enabling the execution of the formalism and the visualization of the results.},

	Abstract = {Many scholars assume a connection between the evolution of language and that of distinctively human group-level morality. Unfortunately, such thinkers frequently downplay a central implication of modern Darwinian theory, which precludes the possibility of innate psychological mechanisms evolving to benefit the group at the expense of the individual. Group level moral regulation is indeed central to sexual, social and political life in all known hunter-gatherer communities. The production of speech acts would be impossible without such regulation. The challenge, therefore, is to explain on a Darwinian basis how life could have become subject to the rule of law. Only then will we have an appropriate social framework in which to contextualize our models of how language may have evolved.},

	Abstract = {This paper describes a study in the use of digital evolution to produce cooperative communication behavior in a population of digital organisms. The results demonstrate that digital evolution can produce organisms capable of distributed problem solving through interactions between members of the population and their environment. Specifically, the organisms cooperate to distribute among the population the largest value sensed from the environment. These digital organisms have no 'built-in' ability to perform this task; each population begins with a single organism that has only the ability to self-replicate. Over thousands of generations, random mutations and natural selection produce an instruction sequence that realizes this behavior, despite continuous turnover in the population.},

@article{komarova04optimizing,
	Abstract = {We consider the problem of linguistic agents that communicate with each other about a shared world. We develop a formal notion of a language as a set of probabilistic associations between form (lexical or syntactic) and meaning (semantic) that has general applicability. Using this notion, we define a natural measure of the mutual intelligibility, F(L,L'), between two agents, one using the language L and the other using L'. We then proceed to investigate three important questions within this framework: (1) Given a language L, what language L' maximizes mutual intelligibility with L? We find surprisingly that L' need not be the same as L and we present algorithms for approximating L' arbitrarily well. (2) How can one learn to optimally communicate with a user of language L when L is unknown at the outset and the learner is allowed a finite number of linguistic interactions with the user of L? We describe possible algorithms and calculate explicit bounds on the number of interactions needed. (3) Consider a population of linguistic agents that learn from each other and evolve over time. Will the community converge to a shared language and what is the nature of such a language? We characterize the evolutionarily stable states of a population of linguistic agents in a game-theoretic setting. Our analysis has significance for a number of areas in natural and artificial communication where one studies the design, learning, and evolution of linguistic communication systems.},

@article{komarova01theEvolutionary,
	Abstract = {Grammar is the computational system of language. It is a set of rules that specifies how to construct sentences out of words. Grammar is the basis of the unlimited expressibility of human language. Children acquire the grammar of their native language without formal education simply by hearing a number of sample sentences. Children could not solve this learning task if they did not have some pre-formed expectations. In other words, children have to evaluate the sample sentences and choose one grammar out of a limited set of candidate grammars. The restricted search space and the mechanism which allows to evaluate the sample sentences is called universal grammar. Universal grammar cannot be learned; it must be in place when the learning process starts. In this paper, we design a mathematical theory that places the problem of language acquisition into an evolutionary context. We formulate equations for the population dynamics of communication and grammar learning. We ask how accurate children have to learn the grammar of their parents' language for a population of individuals to evolve and maintain a coherent grammatical system. It turns out that there is a maximum error tolerance for which a predominant grammar is stable. We calculate the maximum size of the search space that is compatible with coherent communication in a population. Thus, we specify the conditions for the evolution of universal grammar.},

@article{komarova03languageDynamics,
	Abstract = {Any mechanism of language acquisition can only learn a restricted set of grammars. The human brain contains a mechanism for language acquisition which can learn a restricted set of grammars. The theory of this restricted set is universal grammar (UG). UG has to be sufficiently specific to induce linguistic coherence in a population. This phenomenon is known as ``coherence threshold''. Previously, we have calculated the coherence threshold for deterministic dynamics and infinitely large populations. Here, we extend the framework to stochastic processes and finite populations. If there is selection for communicative function (selective language dynamics), then the analytic results for infinite populations are excellent approximations for finite populations; as expected, finite populations need a slightly higher accuracy of language acquisition to maintain coherence. If there is no selection for communicative function (neutral language dynamics), then linguistic coherence is only possible for finite populations.},

	Abstract = {The language acquisition period in humans lasts about 13 years. After puberty it becomes increasingly difficult to learn a language. We explain this phenomenon by using an evolutionary framework. We present a dynamical system describing competition between language acquisition devices, which differ in the length of the learning period. There are two selective forces that play a role in determining the critical learning period: (i) having a longer learning period increases the accuracy of language acquisition; (ii) learning is associated with certain costs that affect fitness. As a result, there exists a limited learning period which is evolutionarily stable. This result is obtained analytically by means of a Nash equilibrium analysis of language acquisition devices. Interestingly, the evolutionarily stable learning period does not maximize the average fitness of the population.},

A simple lexical matrix is also at the center of any animal communication system, where it defines the associations between form and meaning of animal signals. We study the evolution and population dynamics of the lexical matrix. We assume that children learn the lexical matrix of their parents. This learning process is subject to mistakes: (i) children may not acquire all lexical items of their parents (incomplete learning); and (ii) children might acquire associations between word forms and word meanings that differ from their parents' lexical items (incorrect learning). We derive an analytic framework that deals with incomplete learning. We calculate the maximum error rate that is compatible with a population maintaining a coherent lexical matrix of a given size. We calculate the equilibrium distribution of the number of lexical items known to individuals.

@article{kosmidis05twoInteractingSpecies,
	Abstract = {We use Monte Carlo simulations and assumptions from evolutionary game theory in order to study the evolution of words and the population dynamics of a system made of two interacting species which initially speak two different languages. The species are characterized by their identity, vocabulary, and have different initial fitness, i.e. reproduction capability. We investigate how different initial fitness affects the vocabulary of the species or the population dynamics by leading to a permanent populational advantage. We further find that the spatial distributions of the species may cause the system to exhibit pattern formation or segregation. We show that an initial fitness advantage, even though very quickly balanced, leads to better spatial arrangement and enhances survival probabilities of the species. In most cases the system will arrive at a final state where both languages coexist. However, in cases where one species greatly outnumbers the other in population and fitness, then only one species survives with its 'final' language having a slightly richer vocabulary than its initial language. Thus, our results offer an explanation for the existence and origin of synonyms in spoken languages.},

@article{krakauer01selectiveImitation,
	Abstract = {A distinctive feature of all human languages is the diverse and arbitrary nature of the sign (signifier). This can be interpreted as stating that the mapping between signals and referents is established by convention rather than by functional constraints. This property of the sign provides for a great deal of linguistic flexibility and is a key component of symbolic communication. Game theoretic models to describe signal imitation are investigated with a view to understanding how non-arbitrary (indexical) animal-style signals might 'evolve' culturally into diverse, arbitrary signs. I explore the evolutionary hypothesis that private, arbitrary signs emerge as a result of selective imitation within a socially structured population. Once arbitrary signs have emerged, they contribute towards greater assortative interactions among individuals using a shared sign system. In natural populations, the models for imitation will very often be close kin. Hence, kinship provides one mechanism for the creation of true symbols. An imitation-structured population can support many more sign systems than an equivalent non-structured population and is one in which symbols become the dominant force in assortative interactions.},

@article{krakauer95animalCommunication,
	Abstract = {Conflicts of interest arise between signaller and receiver in most kinds of biological communication. Some authors have argued that this conflict is likely to give rise to deceit and exploitation, as receivers lag behind in the coevolutionary 'arms race' with signallers. Others have argued that such manipulation is likely to be short-lived and that receivers can avoid being deceived by paying attention to signals that are costly and hence 'unfakeable.' These two views have been hard to reconcile. Here, we present results from simulations of signal evolution using artificial neural networks, which demonstrate that honesty can coexist with a degree of exploitation. Signal cost ensures that receivers are able to obtain some honest information, but is unable to prevent exploitative signalling strategies from gaining short-term benefits. Although any one receiver bias that is open to exploitation will subsist for only a short period of time once signallers begin to take advantage of it, new preferences of this kind are constantly regenerated through selection and random drift. Hidden preferences and sensory exploitation are thus likely to have an enduring influence on the evolution of honest, costly signals. At the same time, honesty and cost are prerequisites for the evolution of exploitation. When signalling is cost-free, selection cannot act to maintain honesty, and receivers rapidly evolve to ignore signals. This leads to a reduction in the extent of hidden preference, and a consequent loss of potential for exploitation.},

@article{krakauer95honestSignalling,
	Abstract = {Models of animal signalling stress that among unrelated individuals the transfer of honest information normally requires that signals are costly, and costly in a way related to the true information revealed by the signal. In the absence of such a cost, `cheats', that lie about their states or needs, are able to evolve and exploit the preferences of receivers. We show here that spatial constraints imposed on the interactions between signallers and receivers favour honest signalling even in the absence of any costs: `islands' of honesty coexist in `seas' of dishonesty. The extent to which honest or dishonest strategies are favoured, is shown to depend upon the relative payoffs from signalling and receiving. As the receiving component of fitness becomes greater than the signalling component of fitness, as might be true in `life-dinner' type interactions, honesty is increasingly favoured. In addition, in spatial populations, honesty can be favoured locally even when the mean global payoffs to honesty are lower than the mean payoffs to dishonesty. Our model provides a general framework for analysing signals in spatially structured populations and might therefore apply to signalling in both natural and cultural situations.},

Here, it is argued that an essential prerequisite is the ability to build up mental representations of external situations to uncouple the behaviour from direct environmental control. Such representations can be realized by building up cell assemblies. The recurrent neural network presented to cope with this task has been used for generation of action but can also be utilized as a basis for mental representations due to its attractor characteristics. In this context, a new learning algorithm (Dynamic Delta Rule) is proposed, which leads to a self-organized weight distribution yielding stable states on the one hand and which, on the other hand, only activates subpopulations of larger networks that code for the respective situation. In a second step, ways are shown of how the static information of these internal models can be transformed into time-dependent behavioural sequences.},

@article{kvasnicka99alife,
	Abstract = {The purpose of this article is to demonstrate that coordinated communication spontaneously emerges in a population composed of agents that are capable of specific cognitive activities. Internal states of agents are characterized by meaning vectors. Simple neural networks composed of one layer of hidden neurons perform cognitive activities of agents. An elementary communication act consists of theollowing: (a) two agents are selected, where one of them is declared the speaker and the other the listener; (b) the speaker codes a selected meaning vector onto a sequence of symbols and sends it to the listener as a message; and finally, (c) the listener decodes this message into a meaning vector and adapts his or her neural network such that the differences between speaker and listener meaning vectors are decreased. A Darwinian evolution enlarged by ideas from the Baldwin effect and Dawkins{\~O}memes is simulated by a simple version of an evolutionary algorithm without crossover. The¿ent fitness is determined by success of the mutual pairwise communications. It is demonstrated that agents in the course of evolution gradually do a better job of decoding received messages (they are closer to meaning vectors of speakers) and all agents gradually start to use the same vocabulary for the common communication. Moreover, if agent meaning vectors contain regularities, then these regularities are manifested also in messages created by agent speakers, that is, similar parts of meaning vectors are coded by similar symbol substrings. This observation is considered a manifestation of the emergence of a grammar system in the common coordinated communication.},

@article{lachlan03,

In this paper, we examine the coevolution of such genes with the culturally transmitted communication traits themselves, using deterministic population genetic models. We argue that examining how restrictive genetic predispositions are is a useful way of examining the evolutionary origin and maintenance of learning. Under neutral cultural evolution, where no cultural trait has any inherent advantage over another, there is selection in favour of less restrictive genes (genes that allow a wider range of signals to recognized). In contrast, cultural conformity (where the most common cultural trait is favoured) leads to selection in favour of more restrictive genes.},

@article{lachmann01costAnd,
	Abstract = {The costly signaling hypothesis proposes that animal signals are kept honest by appropriate signal costs. We show that to the contrary, signal cost is unnecessary for honest signaling even when interests conflict. We illustrate this principle by constructing examples of cost-free signaling equilibria for the two paradigmatic signaling games of Grafen (1990) and Godfray (1991). Our findings may explain why some animal signals use cost to ensure honesty whereas others do not and suggest that empirical tests of the signaling hypothesis should focus not on equilibrium cost but, rather, on the cost of deviation from equilibrium. We use these results to apply costly signaling theory to the low-cost signals that make up human language. Recent game theoretic models have shown that several key features of language could plausibly arise and be maintained by natural selection when individuals have coincident interests. In real societies, however, individuals do not have fully coincident interests. We show that coincident interests are not a prerequisite for linguistic communication, and find that many of the results derived previously can be expected also under more realistic models of society.},

@article{lai01FOXP2,
	Abstract = {Individuals affected with developmental disorders of speech and language have substantial difficulty acquiring expressive and/or receptive language in the absence of any profound sensory or neurological impairment and despite adequate intelligence and opportunity. Although studies of twins consistently indicate that a significant genetic component is involved, most families segregating speech and language deficits show complex patterns of inheritance, and a gene that predisposes individuals to such disorders has not been identified. We have studied a unique three-generation pedigree, KE, in which a severe speech and language disorder is transmitted as an autosomal-dominant monogenic trait. Our previous work mapped the locus responsible, SPCH1, to a 5.6-cM interval of region 7q31 on chromosome 7 (ref. 5). We also identified an unrelated individual, CS, in whom speech and language impairment is associated with a chromosomal translocation involving the SPCH1 interval. Here we show that the gene FOXP2, which encodes a putative transcription factor containing a polyglutamine tract and a forkhead DNA-binding domain, is directly disrupted by the translocation breakpoint in CS. In addition, we identify a point mutation in affected members of the KE family that alters an invariant amino-acid residue in the forkhead domain. Our findings suggest that FOXP2 is involved in the developmental process that culminates in speech and language.},

@article{lansing07languageAndGene,
	Abstract = {Numerous studies indicate strong associations between languages and genes among human populations at the global scale, but all broader scale genetic and linguistic patterns must arise from processes originating at the community level. We examine linguistic and genetic variation in a contact zone on the eastern Indonesian island of Sumba, where Neolithic Austronesian farming communities settled and began interacting with aboriginal foraging societies approximately 3,500 years ago. Phylogenetic reconstruction based on a 200-word Swadesh list sampled from 29 localities supports the hypothesis that Sumbanese languages derive from a single ancestral Austronesian language. However, the proportion of cognates (words with a common origin) traceable to Proto-Austronesian (PAn) varies among language subgroups distributed across the island. Interestingly, a positive correlation was found between the percentage of Y chromosome lineages that derive from Austronesian (as opposed to aboriginal) ancestors and the retention of PAn cognates. We also find a striking correlation between the percentage of PAn cognates and geographic distance from the site where many Sumbanese believe their ancestors arrived on the island. These language-gene-geography correlations, unprecedented at such a fine scale, imply that historical patterns of social interaction between expanding farmers and resident hunter-gatherers largely explain community-level language evolution on Sumba. We propose a model to explain linguistic and demographic coevolution at fine spatial and temporal scales.},

@inproceedings{lanyon06evolang,
	Abstract = {The debate over the evolution of an innate language capacity seems to divide into two principle camps. The neo-Darwinian approach generally argues that human psychological modules, in- cluding the language faculty, must have arisen gradually and incrementally having been honed by natural selection. Thus Pinker, when theorizing about language evolution, sees ''no reason to doubt that the principle explanation is the same as for any other complex instinct or organ, Darwin's theory of natural selection'' (Pinker, 1994, 333). However, as Knight et al. (2000) have pointed out, little attention has been paid by the neo-Darwinian approach to address the causes of the emergence of novelty. The saltationist approach gleans much of its evidence from the archaeological and paleontological record, which is interpreted as unsupportive of the neo-Darwinian paradigm. Jackendoff (1999) accuses those who do not accept that language arose gradually through natural selection as having been ''forced to devalue evolutionary argu- mentation''. Jackendoff's concern seems to stem from the view that there is only one way that evolution can proceed, through gradual change driven by natural selection. My concern is for the neglect of the vast amount of evidence supporting the theory that modern humans did not emerged in a gradual, step-wise fashion, so there is no reason to believe that cognition and lan- guage evolved in this manner. Here I argue that hominins evolved through major evolutionary leaps, which may have numbered only two or three significant mutation 'events'. Neoteny (the retention of infant or juvenile growth rates) appears to have been a major force in the evolu- tion of our primate ancestors and this process can explain the sudden emergence of many of the traits that define what it means to be human. Further evidence from the fossil and archaeological record supports a 'sudden' emergence of human cognition and language.},

For example, analytic studies of simple language in unstructured populations have shown complex dynamics, depending on the fidelity of language transmission. In this study we extend these analysis of evolutionary dynamics to include grammars inspired by the principles and parameters paradigm. In particular, the space of languages is structured so that some pairs of languages are more similar than others, and mutations tend to change languages to nearby variants. We found that coherence emerges with lower learning fidelity than predicted by earlier work with an unstructured language space.},

@article{lenaerts05orthogonalApproach,
	Abstract = {Evolutionary game dynamics have been proposed as a mathematical framework for the cultural evolution of language and more specifically the evolution of vocabulary. This article discusses a model that is mutually exclusive in its underlying principals with some previously suggested models. The model describes how individuals in a population culturally acquire a vocabulary by actively participating in the acquisition process instead of passively observing and communicate through peer-to-peer interactions instead of vertical parent-offspring relations. Concretely, a notion of social/cultural learning called the naming game is first abstracted using learning theory. This abstraction defines the required cultural transmission mechanism for an evolutionary process. Second, the derived transmission system is expressed in terms of the well-known selection-mutation model defined in the context of evolutionary dynamics. In this way, the analogy between social learning and evolution at the level of meaning-word associations is made explicit. Although only horizontal and oblique transmission structures will be considered, extensions to vertical structures over different genetic generations can easily be incorporated. We provide a number of simplified experiments to clarify our reasoning.},

It is unclear how understanding can arise among individuals utilizing such arbitrary codes, and specifically, whether evolution unaided by individual learning is sufficient to produce such understanding. Using a genetic algorithm implemented on a computer, I demonstrate that a significant though imperfect level of understanding can be achieved by organisms through evolution alone. The population as a whole settles on one particular scheme of coding/decoding information (there are no separate dialects). Several features of such evolving systems are explored and it is shown that the system as a whole is stable against perturbation along many different kinds of ecological parameters.},

Both symbol sequences and propositional meanings are represented by high-dimensional vectors of real numbers. A neural network learns to map between the distributed representations of the symbol sequences and the distributed representations of the propositions. Unlike previous neural network models of language evolution, our model uses a Kohonen Self-Organizing Map with unsupervised learning, thereby avoiding the computational slowdown and biological implausibility of back-propagation networks and the lack of scalability associated with Hebbian-learning networks. After several evolutionary generations, the network develops systematically regular mappings between meanings and sequences, of the sort traditionally associated with symbolic grammars. Because of the potential of neural-like representations for addressing the symbol-grounding problem, this sort of model holds a good deal of promise as a new explanatory mechanism for both language evolution and acquisition.},

	Abstract = {Following on from the work of Luc Steels, this paper presents a model of Concept Formation and the subsequent use of Language Games to share those concepts in a society of artificial agents. <p> The system is naturally driven towards stability due to two important mechanisms. In the Concept Formation stage, Simple Competitive Learning results in the formation of normative categories due to the identification of naturally occurring clusters of input data. In the Language Sharing stage, the preference for words that are frequently used creates a positive feedback loop towards linguistic coherence. <p> The model can be seen as an extension to Steels' work because it makes an important generalisation. In Steels' model, all inputs are one-dimensional and categories are formed and refined by repeatedly bisecting the space. In this model the Input Space can have any dimension and is partitioned into categories of different shapes which are not fixed. <p> The nature of the Input Space is deliberately very general - any number of dimensions and distribution of data can be specified. Consequently the model can be applied to any categorisation situation and is relevant to both scientific research and commercial applications. <p> This paper begins by imitating the model used by Steels and then goes on to show the importance of a ``forgetting mechanism'' in order to improve communicative success. Higher dimensional spaces are then considered and the effect of various parameters on communicative success is examined. In particular, the importance of choosing the number of objects in the Language Game correctly is explained. Finally, agents' adaptability to a foreign environment is investigated by mixing two distinct populations.},

The network consists of two self-organizing maps (a growing semantic map and a growing phonological map) that are connected via associative links trained by Hebbian learning. The model captures a number of important phenomena that occur in early lexical acquisition by children, as it allows for the representation of a dynamically changing linguistic environment in language learning. In our simulations, DevLex develops topographically organized representations for linguistic categories over time, models lexical confusion as a function of word density and semantic similarity, and shows age-of-acquisition effects in the course of learning a growing lexicon. These results match up with patterns from empirical research on lexical development, and have significant implications for models of language acquisition based on self-organizing neural networks.},

@article{lieberman07verbFrequencyNATURE,
	Abstract = {Human language is based on grammatical rules. Cultural evolution allows these rules to change over time. Rules compete with each other: as new rules rise to prominence, old ones die away. To quantify the dynamics of language evolution, we studied the regularization of English verbs over the past 1,200 years. Although an elaborate system of productive conjugations existed in English's proto-Germanic ancestor, Modern English uses the dental suffix, '-ed', to signify past tense. Here we describe the emergence of this linguistic rule amidst the evolutionary decay of its exceptions, known to us as irregular verbs. We have generated a data set of verbs whose conjugations have been evolving for more than a millennium, tracking inflectional changes to 177 Old-English irregular verbs. Of these irregular verbs, 145 remained irregular in Middle English and 98 are still irregular today. We study how the rate of regularization depends on the frequency of word usage. The half-life of an irregular verb scales as the square root of its usage frequency: a verb that is 100 times less frequent regularizes 10 times as fast. Our study provides a quantitative analysis of the regularization process by which ancestral forms gradually yield to an emerging linguistic rule.},

@article{lieberman07evolutionOfSpeech,
	Abstract = {Human speech involves species-specific anatomy deriving from the descent of the tongue into the pharynx. The human tongue's shape and position yields the 1:1 oral-to-pharyngeal proportions of the supralaryngeal vocal tract. Speech also requires a brain that can ``reiterate''--freely reorder a finite set of motor gestures to form a potentially infinite number of words and sentences. The end points of the evolutionary process are clear. The chimpanzee lacks a supralaryngeal vocal tract capable of producing the ``quantal'' sounds which facilitate both speech production and perception and a brain that can reiterate the phonetic contrasts apparent in its fixed vocalizations. The traditional Broca-Wernicke brain-language theory is incorrect; neural circuits linking regions of the cortex with the basal ganglia and other subcortical structures regulate motor control, including speech production, as well as cognitive processes including syntax. The dating of the FOXP2 gene, which governs the embryonic development of these subcortical structures, provides an insight on the evolution of speech and language. The starting points for human speech and language were perhaps walking and running. However, fully human speech anatomy first appears in the fossil record in the Upper Paleolithic (about 50,000 years ago) and is absent in both Neanderthals and earlier humans.},

@article{lieberman05piedPiper,
	Abstract = {The major ''contribution'' of generative grammar to cognitive science is negative. The hermetic disjuncture of linguistic research from biological principles and facts has influenced cognitive science. Linguists have followed the pied piper taking a different path from that pointed out by Charles Darwin. As Dobzhansky (1973) noted, ''Nothing in biology makes sense except in the light of evolution.'' The hermetic nature of much linguistic research is apparent even in phonology which must reflect biological facts concerning speech production. For example, studies dating back to 1928 show that tongue ''features'' do not specify vowel distinctions. However, the irrefutable findings of these cineradiographic and MRI studies are generally ignored by linguists. Chomsky's central premise, that syntactic ability derives from an innate ''Universal Grammar'' common to all human beings constitutes a strong biological claim. But if a UG genetically similar for all ''normal'' individuals existed, one of the central premises of Darwinian evolutionary biology, genetic variation would be false. Concepts and processes borrowed from linguistics such as ''modularity'' have impeded our understanding of brain-behavior relations. Some aspects of behavior are regulated in specific localized ''modules'' in the brain, but current research demonstrates that the neural architecture regulating human language is also implicated in motor control, cognition, and other aspects of behavior. The neural bases of enhanced human language are not separable from cognition and motor ability. The supposed unique aspect of syntax, its ''reiterative'' productivity, appears to derive from subcortical structures that play a part in neural circuits regulating motor control. Natural selection aimed at enhancing adaptive motor control ultimately yielded a basal ganglia ''sequencing engine'' that can produce a potentially infinite number of novel actions, thoughts , or ''sentences'' from a finite number of basic elements. Recent studies suggest that the human FOXP2 gene, which differs from similar regulatory genes in chimpanzees and other mammals, acts on the basal ganglia and other subcortical structures to confer enhanced human reiterative ability in domains as different as syntax and dancing. The probable date of the critical mutations on FOXP2 is coincident with the appearance of anatomically modern human beings about 150,000 to 200,000 years ago. Humans thus can create more complex sentences than chimpanzees, but has anyone ever seen an ape dancing?},

@article{lieberman02yearbook,
	Abstract = {The traditional theory equating the brain bases of language with Broca's and Wernicke's neocortical areas is wrong. Neural circuits linking activity in anatomically segregated populations of neurons in subcortical structures and the neocortex throughout the human brain regulate complex behaviors such as walking, talking, and comprehending the meaning of sentences. When we hear or read a word, neural structures involved in the perception or real-world associations of the word are activated as well as posterior cortical regions adjacent to Wernicke's area. Many areas of the neocortex and subcortical structures support the cortical-striatal-cortical circuits that confer complex syntactic ability, speech production, and a large vocabulary. However, many of these structures also form part of the neural circuits regulating other aspects of behavior. For example, the basal ganglia, which regulate motor control, are also crucial elements in the circuits that confer human linguistic ability and abstract reasoning. The cerebellum, traditionally associated with motor control, is active in motor learning. The basal ganglia are also key elements in reward-based learning. Data from studies of Broca's aphasia, Parkinson's disease, hypoxia, focal brain damage, and a genetically transmitted brain anomaly (the putative ``language gene,'' family KE), and from comparative studies of the brains and behavior of other species, demonstrate that the basal ganglia sequence the discrete elements that constitute a complete motor act, syntactic process, or thought process. Imaging studies of intact human subjects and electrophysiologic and tracer studies of the brains and behavior of other species confirm these findings. As Dobzansky put it, ``Nothing in biology makes sense except in the light of evolution'' (cited in Mayr, 1982). That applies with as much force to the human brain and the neural bases of language as it does to the human foot or jaw. The converse follows: the mark of evolution on the brains of human beings and other species provides insight into the evolution of the brain bases of human language. The neural substrate that regulated motor control in the common ancestor of apes and humans most likely was modified to enhance cognitive and linguistic ability. Speech communication played a central role in this process. However, the process that ultimately resulted in the human brain may have started when our earliest hominid ancestors began to walk.},

	Abstract = {This chapter explores the psychological basis of lexical ambiguity. We compare three ways of meaning calculation, including meanings listed in dictionaries, meanings provided by human subjects, and meanings analyzed by a linguistic theory. Two experiments were conducted using both Chinese and English data. The results suggest that while the numbers of meanings obtained by different methods are significantly different from one another, they are also significantly correlated. Different ways of meaning calculation produce distinct numbers of meanings, though on a relative scale, words with more meanings tend to have greater numbers of meanings throughout. Dictionary meanings are to be distinguished from meanings obtained from subjects both in content and in numbers. These results are then discussed with regard to their methodological implications for further research on psycho- semantics and semantic change.},

In particular, we explore the meaning negotiations among communicating agents. The self-organizing map is used as a model of an agent's conceptual memory. The concepts are not explicitly given but they are learned by the agent in an unsupervised manner. Concepts are viewed as areas formed in a self-organizing map based on unsupervised learning. The language acquisition process is modeled in a population of simulated agents by using a series of language games, specifically observational games. The results of the simulation experiments verify that the agents learn to communicate successfully and a shared lexicon emerges.

@phdthesis{livingstone03phdthesis,
	Abstract = {The emergence and evolution of human language has been the focus of increasing amounts of research activity in recent years. This increasing interest has been coincident with the increased use of computer simulation, particularly using one or more of the methods and techniques of `Artificial Life', to investigate a wide range of evolutionary problems and questions. There is now a significant body of work that uses such computer simulations to investigate the evolution of language. <p> In this thesis a broad review of work on the evolution of language is presented, showing that language evolution occurs as two distinct evolutionary processes. The ability to use language is clearly the result of biological evolution. But the changes that occur over time to all spoken languages can also be viewed as being part of a process of cultural evolution. In this thesis, work using artificial life models to investigate each of these processes is reviewed. A review of the methods and techniques used in artificial life is also presented early in the work. <p> A novel model is developed which is used to explore the conditions necessary for the evolution of language. Interesting results from initial tests of the model highlight the role of redundancy in language. From these initial tests, the model is further developed to explore the biological evolution of the human capacity for language. One significant outcome of this work is to highlight the limitations of the model for developing, and especially for `proving', particular theories on how or why Homo sapiens alone evolved language. This is tied to a brief review showing that this weakness is not one specific to this particular model, but may be one that is possessed by all artificial life models that try to explain the origins of language. <p> With further minor modifications to the model, the focus is shifted to the evolution of languages and language diversity. In comparison with some of the earlier conclusions, this work emphasises the positive contribution to ongoing scientific debate that is possible using computer simulations. In this case, experiments using the model focus on whether social and/or linguistic benefits are required in explanations of language change. A review and debate is then presented on work that contradicts our findings. Further corroboration of our conclusions is then gained by conducting a similar experiment using a different computer model. <p> The key contributions of this interdisciplinary work are: first, in detailing some of the unique problems and issues inherent in using computer models specifically for modelling the evolution of language; second, in emphasising the importance of redundancy in language evolution; and finally, in adding to the current debate on whether the evolution of languages can be viewed as a form of adaptively neutral evolution.},

@article{locke05lifeHistoryBBS,
	Abstract = {It has long been claimed that Homo sapiens is the only species that has symbolic language, but only recently recognized that humans also have an unusual pattern of growth and development. Social mammals have two stages of pre-adult development: infancy and juvenility. Humans have two additional prolonged and pronounced life history stages: childhood---an interval of four years extending between infancy and the juvenile period that follows---and adolescence---a stage of about eight years that stretches from juvenility to adulthood. We begin by reviewing the primary biological and linguistic changes occurring in each of the four preadult ontogenetic stages in life history. Then we attempt to trace the evolution of childhood and juvenility in our hominid ancestors. We propose that several different forms of selection applied in infancy and childhood; and that in adolescence, elaborated vocal behaviors played a role in courtship and intrasexual competition, enhancing fitness and ultimately integrating performative and pragmatic skills with linguistic knowledge in a broad faculty of language. A theoretical consequence of our proposal is that fossil evidence of the uniquely human stages may be used, with other findings, to date the emergence of language. If important aspects of language cannot appear until sexual maturity, as we propose, then a second consequence is that the development of language requires the whole of modern human ontogeny. Our life history model thus offers new ways of investigating, and thinking about, the evolution, development, and ultimately the nature of human language.},

Baldwin's proposal, however, is highly controversial, in that the empirical support for it is far from conclusive. The aim of this article is to critically examine one of the main sources of evidence adduced in support of the Baldwin Effect, namely its alleged parity, as repeatedly assumed in Briscoe's (2000, 2002, 2003, 2005) approach to language phylogeny, with Waddington's genetic assimilation. It is argued here, however, that Baldwin's and Waddington's mechanisms are fundamentally different, and that this has important consequences for Briscoe's evolutionary model.},

However, sciences of complex-ity have shown, from a wide range of domains, the existence of a clear alternative: self-organisation, spontaneous patterns of order arising from chaos. According to this view, design derives from internal factors (dynamic interaction of the ele-ments within the system) rather than from adaptation to the environment by means of selection. This paper aims to apply sciences of complexity to language origins; it shows that preexisting and well established ideas can be rethought ac-cording to such a view. The main objective of the paper is to illustrate the new and promising horizons that complexity could open as regards the origins of the most specific property of human beings.},

We show that the modelling of the other agent is insufficient in the simplest possible case, unless the intentions can also be modelled. The model of the agent and its intentions enable quick agreements about symbol-meaning association. We show that when both agents assume an intention model about the other agent then the symbol-meaning association process can be spoiled and symbol meaning association may become hard.},

In order to design the environment and creatures, we seek theoretical and empirical constraints from C.S.Peirce Semiotics and an ethological case study of communication among animals. Our results show that the creatures, assuming the role of sign users and learners, behave collectively as a complex system, where self-organization of communicative interactions plays a major role in the emergence of symbol-based communication. We also strive for a careful use of the theoretical concepts involved, including the concepts of symbol, communication, and emergence, and we use a multi-level model as a basis for the interpretation of inter-level relationships in the semiotic processes we are studying.},

Further, it captures essential features of the scaling properties of the agreement process for spatially-embedded autonomous agents.

@inproceedings{lupyan06evolang,
	Abstract = {A major feature that sets language apart from other communication systems is the use of categorylabels -- words. In addition to providing a means of communication, there is growing evidence that category labels play a role in the formation and shaping of concepts. If verbal labels help humans acquire or use category information, one can ask whether it is easier to learn labeled categories compared to unlabeled ones. Normal English-speaking adults participated in a category-learning task in which categories were labeled or unlabeled. The presence of labels facilitated the learning of unfamiliar categories and resulted in more robust category representations. The advantage for acquiring named categories was observed even though the category labels did not convey any additional information and all participants had equivalent experience categorizing the stimuli. This work provides empirical support for the idea of labels as conceptual anchor points (Clark, 1997).},

	Abstract = {We examine evidence for the hypothesis that language could have passed through a stage when words were combined in structured linear segments and these linear segments could later have become the building blocks for a full hierarchical grammar. Experiments were carried out on the British National Corpus, consisting of about 100 million words of text from different domains and transcribed speech. This work extends and supports the results of our previous work based on a smaller corpus reported previously. Measuring the entropy of the texts we find that entropy declines as words are taken in groups of 2, 3 and 4, indicating that it is easier to decode words taken in short sequences rather than individually. Entropy further declines when punctuation is represented, showing that appropriate segmentation captures some of the language structure. Further support for the hypothesis that local sequential processing underlies the production and perception of speech comes from neurobiological evidence. The observation that homophones are apparently ubiquitous and used without confusion also suggests that language processing may be largely based on local context.},

For the foresee- able future, the complexities of natural life in its natural environment will preclude such an understanding. An approach more conducive to carefully controlled experiments and to the discovery of deep laws of great generality is to study synthetic life forms in a synthetic world to which they have become coupled through evolution. This is the approach of synthetic ethology. Some simple synthetic ethology ex- periments are described in which we have observed the evolution of communication in a population of simple machines. We show that even in these simple worlds we find some of the richness and complexity found in natural communication.},

After a discussion of the goals and methods of synthetic ethology, two series of experiments are described based on at least 5000 breeding cycles. The first demonstrates the evolution of cooperative communication in a population of simple machines. The average fitness of the population and the organization of its use of signals are compared under three conditions: communication suppressed, communication permitted, and communication permitted in the presence of learning. Where communication is permitted the fitness increases about 26 times faster than when communication is suppressed; with communication and learning the rate of fitness increase is about 100 fold. The second series of experiments illustrates the evolution of a syntactically simple language, in which a pair of signals is required for effective communication.},

@article{macneilage98theFrame,
	Abstract = {The species-specific organizational property of speech is a continual mouth open-close alternation, the two phases of which are subject to continual articulatory modulation. The cycle constitutes the syllable and the open and closed phases are segments - vowels and consonants respectively. The fact that segmental serial ordering errors in normal adults obey syllable structure constraints suggests that syllabic ``Frames'' and segmental ``Content'' elements are separately controlled in the speech production process. The frames may derive from cycles of mandibular oscillation, present in humans from babbling onset, which are responsible for the open-close alternation. These communication-related frames perhaps first evolved when the ingestion-related cyclicities of mandibular oscillation (associated with mastication (chewing) sucking and licking) took on communicative significance as lipsmacks, tonguesmacks and teeth chatters - displays which are prominent in many nonhuman primates. The new role of Broca's area and its surround in human vocal communication may have derived from its evolutionary history as the main cortical center for the control of ingestive processes. The frame and content components of speech may have subsequently evolved separate realizations within two general-purpose primate motor control systems: (1) A motivation-related medial ``intrinsic'' system, including anterior cingulate cortex and the supplementary motor area, for self-generated behavior, formerly responsible for ancestral vocalization control and now also responsible for frames, and (2) a lateral ``extrinsic'' system, including Broca's area and surround, and Wernicke's area, specialized for response to external input (and therefore the emergent vocal learning capacity) and more responsible for Content.},

	Abstract = {This study shows that a corpus of proto-word forms shares four sequential sound patterns with words of modern languages and the first words of infants. Three of the patterns involve intrasyllabic consonant-vowel (CV) co-occurrence: labial (lip) consonants with central vowels, coronal (tongue front) consonants with front vowels, and dorsal (tongue back) consonants with back vowels. The fourth pattern is an intersyllabic preference for initiating words with a labial consonant-vowel-coronal consonant sequence (LC). The CV effects may be primarily biomechanically motivated. The LC effect may be self-organizational, with multivariate causality. The findings support the hypothesis that these four patterns were basic to the origin of words.},

@article{macneilage01evolutionOf,
	Abstract = {The basic internal structure of a word consists of an alternation between consonants and vowels. Words tend to begin with a consonant and end with a vowel. The fundamental evolutionary status of the consonant-vowel alternation is indicated by its presence in rhythmically organized pre-linguistic vocalizations of 7 month-old babbling infants. We have argued that the basic alternation results from a mandibular cyclicity (``The Frame'') originally evolving for ingestive purposes. Here, we consider beginnings and endings of words. We conclude that preferences for consonantal beginnings and vocalic endings may be basic biomechanical consequences of the act of producing vocal episodes between resting states of the production system. Both the characteristic beginning-end asymmetry and some details of the choice of individual sounds in the non-preferred modes (vocalic beginnings and consonantal endings) are mirrored in babbling and early words. The presence of many of these properties in modern words, even though they are delivered in running speech, as well as in a proto-language corpus, indicates retention, for message purposes, of properties originally associated with the single word stage of language evolution.},

The emergentist framework emphasizes ways in which the formal structures of language emerge from the interaction of social patterns, patterns implicit in the input, and pressures arising from general aspects of the cognitive system. Emergentist models have been developed to study the acquisition of auditory and articulatory patterns during infancy and the ways in which the learning of the first words emerges from the linkage of auditory, articulatory, and conceptual systems. Neural network models have also been used to study the learning of inflectional markings and basic syntactic patterns. Using both neural network modeling and concepts from the study of dynamic systems, it is possible to analyze language learning as the integration of emergent dynamic systems.},

@article{mace05phylogeneticCultural,
	Abstract = {There has been a rapid increase in the use of phylogenetic methods to study the evolution of languages and culture. Languages fit a tree model of evolution well, at least in their basic vocabulary, challenging the view that blending, or admixture among neighbouring groups, was predominant in cultural history. Here, we argue that we can use language trees to test hypotheses about not only cultural history and diversification, but also bio-cultural adaptation. Phylogenetic comparative methods take account of the non-independence of cultures (Galton's problem), which can cause spurious statistical associations in comparative analyses. Advances in phylogenetic methods offer new possibilities for the analysis of cultural evolution, including estimating the rate of evolution and the direction of coevolutionary change of traits on the tree. They also enable phylogenetic uncertainty to be incorporated into the analyses, so that one does not have to treat phylogenetic trees as if they were known without error.},

We ran a series of experiments on mono-generational and multi-generational populations whose initial state involved agents possessing distinct lexicons. These experiments reveal some clear differences in the lexicon dynamics of populations that acquire words solely by introspection contrasted with populations that learn using MCI or using a mixed strategy of introspection and MCI. Over a single generation the performance between the populations with and without MCI is comparable, in that the lexicon converges and is shared by the whole population. In multi-generational populations lexicon diverges at a faster rate for an introspective population, eventually consisting of one word being associated with every meaning, compared with MCI capable populations in which the lexicon is maintained, where every meaning is associated with a unique word.},

Some simulations have already been done but most are a task for the future. We dis-cuss language evolution under two topics: language is learned from others on the basis of genetically inherited predispositions, and language has important influences on human cognition. We propose an evolutionary sequence accord-ing to which bipedalism and the emergence of the hands represent a selective pressure for developing an ability to predict the consequences of one's actions, this ability is the basis for learning by imitating other individuals, learning by imitating other individuals is applied to learning to imitate their communicative behaviour. The second topic include the consequences of language for various aspects of human cognition, especially when language is used to talk to oneself.},

@article{marocco03pt,
	Abstract = {Evolutionary robotics is a biologically inspired approach to robotics that is advantageous to studying the evolution of communication. A new model for the emergence of communication is developed and tested through various simulation experiments. In the first simulation, the emergence of simple signalling behaviour is studied. This is used to investigate the inter-relationships between communication abilities, namely linguistic production and comprehension, and other behavioural skills. The model supports the hypothesis that the ability to form categories from direct interaction with an environment constitutes the grounds for subsequent evolution of communication and language. In the second simulation, evolutionary robots are used to study the emergence of simple syntactic categories, e.g. action names (verbs). Comparisons between the two simulations indicate that the signalling lexicon emerged in the first simulation follows the evolutionary pattern of nouns, as observed in related models on the evolution of syntactic categories. Results also support the language-origin hypothesis on the fact that nouns precede verbs in both phylogenesis and ontogenesis. Further extensions of this new evolutionary robotic model for testing hypotheses on language origins are also discussed.},

Our purpose in this study is to investigate the efficiency of word inflections with HPSG (Head--driven Phrase Structure Grammar), which is able to deal with these features directly. Using a notion of utility, we measure the efficiency of a grammar in terms of the balance between the number of semantic structures of a sentence, and the cost of agreement according to the number of unification processes. In our experiments, we showed how these were balanced in two different corpora. One, WSJ (Wall Street Journal), includes long and complicated sentences, while the other corpus, ATIS (Air Travel Information System) does shorter colloquial sentences. In the both corpora, agreement is surely important to reduce ambiguity. However, the importance of agreement in the ATIS corpus became salient as personal pronouns were so often employed in it, compared with the WSJ corpus.},

@article{matsen04PNAS,
	Abstract = {Traditional language learning theory explores an idealized interaction between a teacher and a learner. The teacher provides sentences from a language, while the learner has to infer the underlying grammar. Here, we study a new approach by considering a population of individuals that learn from each other. There is no designated teacher. We are inspired by the observation that children grow up to speak the language of their peers, not of their parents. Our goal is to characterize learning strategies that generate ``linguistic coherence,'' which means that most individuals use the same language. We model the resulting learning dynamics as a random walk of a population on a graph. Each vertex represents a candidate language. We find that a simple strategy using a certain aspiration level with the principle of win--stay, lose--shift does extremely well: stay with your current language, if at least three others use that language; otherwise, shift to an adjacent language on the graph. This strategy guarantees linguistic coherence on all nearly regular graphs, in the relevant limit where the number of candidate languages is much greater than the population size. Moreover, for many graphs, it is sufficient to have an aspiration level demanding only two other individuals to use the same language.},

	Abstract = {Empirical data have recently begun to inform debates on the evolutionary origins of music. In this paper we discuss some of our recent findings and related theoretical issues. We claim that theories of the origins of music will be usefully constrained if we can determine which aspects of music perception are innate, and, of those, which are uniquely human and specific to music. Comparative research in nonhuman animals, particularly nonhuman primates, is thus critical to the debate. In this paper we focus on the preferences that characterize most humans' experience of music, testing whether similar preferences exist in nonhuman primates. Our research suggests that many rudimentary acoustic preferences, such as those for consonant over dissonant intervals, may be unique to humans. If these preferences prove to be innate in humans, they may be candidates for music-specific adaptations. To establish whether such preferences are innate in humans, one important avenue for future research will be the collection of data from different cultures. This may be facilitated by studies conducted over the internet.},

	Abstract = {We describe a simulation model of language evolution which integrates synergetic linguistics with multi-agent modeling. On the one hand, this enables to utilize knowledge about the distribution of the parameter values of system variables as a touch stone of simulation validity. On the other hand it allows to account for synergetic interdependencies of microscopic system variables and macroscopic order parameters. This approach goes beyond the classical setting of synergetic linguistics by grounding processes of selfregulation and -organization in mechanisms of (dialogically aligned) language learning. Consequently, the simulation model includes four levels, that are, (i) the level of single information processing agents which are (ii) dialogically aligned in communication processes enslaved (iii) by the social system in which the agents participate and whose countless communication events shape (iv) the corresponding language system. In summary, the present paper is basically conceptual. It outlines a simulation model which bridges between different levels of language modeling kept apart in contemporary simulation models. This model relates to artificial cognition systems in the sense that it may be implemented to endow an artificial agent community in order to perform distributed processes of meaning constitution.},

	Abstract = {Communication plays a vital role in the organization and operation of biological, computational, economic, and social systems. Agents often base their behavior on the signals they receive from others and also recognize the importance of the signals they send. Here we develop a framework for analyzing the emergence of communication in an adaptive system. The framework enables the study of a system composed of agents who evolve the ability to strategically send and receive communication. While the modeling framework is quite general, we focus here on a specific application, namely the analysis of cooperation in a single shot Prisoner?s Dilemma. We find that contrary to initial expectations, communication allows the emergence of cooperation in such a system. Moreover, we find a systematic relationship between the processing and language complexity inherent in the communication system and the observed behavior. The approach developed here should open up a variety of phenomena to the systematic exploration of endogenous, strategic communication.},

@inproceedings{minett06wordOrderBias,
	Abstract = {The majority of extant languages have one of three basic word orders: SVO, SOV or VSO. Various hypotheses have been put forward to explain aspects of this bias, including the existence of a universal grammar, learnability imposed by non-linguistic-specific cognitive constraints, and the descent of the extant languages from a common ancestral proto-language. Here, we adopt a multi-agent model for language emergence that simulates the coevolution of a lexicon and syntax from a holistic signaling system. The syntax evolves through a process of categorization; local syntactic rules are constructed that assign a relative order (e.g., S before V) to the elements of the two categories to which each rule applies. We demonstrate that local syntax encoding the relative position of S and O are the most stable, allowing the coexistence of the global word order pairs SOV/SVO and VOS/OVS. The structure of the semantic space that the language encodes further constrains the global syntax that is stable.},

In this case, music is studied as an adaptive complex dynamic system and its origins and evolution are studied in the context of the cultural conventions that may emerge under a number of constraints (e.g. psychological, physiological and ecological). This paper introduces three case studies of evolutionary modelling of music. It begins with a model for studying the role of mating-selective pressure in the evolution of musical taste. Here the agents evolve ``courting tunes'' in a society of ``male'' composers and ``female'' critics. Next, a mimetic model is introduced to study the evolution of musical expectation in a community of autonomous agents furnished with a vocal synthesizer, a hearing system and memory. Finally, an iterated learning model is proposed for studying the evolution of compositional grammars. In this case, the agents evolve grammars for composing music to express a set of emotions.},

In this article, we focus on the following phylogenetic question: how can communication emerge, given that both signal-producing and signal-responding abilities seem to be adaptively neutral until the complementary ability is present in the population? We explore the problem of co-evolution of speakers and hearers with artificial life simulations: a population of artificial neural networks evolving a food call system. The core of the article is devoted to a careful analysis of the complex evolutionary dynamics demonstrated by our simple simulation. Our analyses reveal an important factor, which might solve the phylogenetic problem: the spontaneous production of good (meaningful) signals by speakers because of the need for organisms to categorize their experience in adaptively relevant ways. We discuss our results with respect both to previous simulative work and to the biological literature on the evolution of communication.},

Using computer simulations of a population of interacting agents whose behaviour is determined by a neural network, we show that a stable communication system does not emerge in groups of unrelated individuals because of its altruistic character. None the less, another set of simulations shows that the emergence of a language that confers an advantage only to hearers, not to speakers, is possible under at least three conditions: (1) if the hearer and the speaker tend to share the same genes, as predicted by kin selection theory; (2) if the population is `docile' and the communication system is culturally transmitted together with other adaptive behaviours, as predicted by Simon's docility theory; and (3) if the linguistic system is used not only for social communication, but also for talking to oneself, in particular as an aid to memory.},

@article{mitchener07universalGrammar,
	Abstract = {We investigate a model of language evolution, based on population game dynamics with learning. Specifically, we examine the case of two genetic variants of universal grammar (UG), the heart of the human language faculty, assuming each admits two possible grammars. The dynamics are driven by a communication game. We prove using dynamical systems techniques that if the payoff matrix obeys certain constraints, then the two UGs are stable against invasion by each other, that is, they are evolutionarily stable. These constraints are independent of the learning process. Intuitively, if a mutation in UG results in grammars that are incompatible with the established languages, then it will die out because individuals with the mutation will be unable to communicate and therefore unable to realize any potential benefit of the mutation. An example for which the proofs do not apply shows that compatible mutations may or may not be able to invade, depending on the population's history and the learning process. These results suggest that the genetic history of language is constrained by the need for compatibility and that mutations in the language faculty may have died out or taken over depending more on historical accident than on any simple notion of relative fitness.},

@incollection{mitchener07middleEnglish,
	Abstract = {Lightfoot (1999) proposes the following explanation for the loss of the verb-second rule in Middle English: There were two regional dialects of Middle English, a northern dialect influenced by Old Norse with a verb- second rule, and a southern dialect with a slightly different word order. Children acquire the verb-second rule based on hearing some critical fraction of cue sentences requiring such a rule. As the dialects experienced increased contact, northern children were less likely to hear enough cue sentences, and consequently acquired a different grammar, resulting in the extinction of the northern dialect. <p> This hypothesis can be modeled with differential equations. By using dynamical systems methods, the catastrophe in question may be modeled by a mathematical event known as a saddle-node bifurcation. A key part of the model is the function that gives the probability of learning the northern dialect given that a fraction of the local population uses it. Other model acquisition algorithms, such as memoryless learner (Niyogi \& Berwick 1996), give the mysterious result that verb-second languages should be extremely stable, in contrast to the history of English. This new model provides an explanation for that behavior: Memoryless learners are more sensitive to noise, resulting in a differently shaped function that does not allow the northern grammar to disappear. This model demonstrates how dynamical systems theory can be used to study language change and learning models.},

	Abstract = {Both Middle English and Old French had a syntactic property called verb-second or V2 that disappeared. This paper describes a simulation being developed to shed light on the question of why V2 is stable in some languages, but not others. The simulation, based on a Markov chain, uses fuzzy grammars where speakers can use an arbitrary mixture of idealized grammars. Thus, it can mimic the variable syntax observed in Middle English manuscripts. The simulation supports the hypotheses that children use the topic of a sentence for word order acquisition, that acquisition takes into account the ambiguity of grammatical information available from sample sentences, and that speakers prefer to speak with more regularity than they observe in the primary linguistic data.},

	Abstract = {Human language is a remarkable communication system, apparently unique among an- imals. All humans have a built-in learning mechanism known as universal grammar or UG. Languages change in regular yet unpredictable ways due to many factors, including properties of UG and contact with other languages. This dissertation extends the standard replicator equation used in evolutionary biology to include a learning process. The resulting language dynamical equation models language change at the population level. In a further extension, members of the population may have di#erent UGs. It models evolution of the language faculty itself. <p> We begin by examining the language dynamical equation in the case where the param- eters are fully symmetric. When learning is very error prone, the population always settles at an equilibrium where all grammars are present. For more accurate learning, coherent equilibria appear, where one grammar dominates the population. We identify all bifurca- tions that take place as learning accuracy increases. This alternation between incoherence and coherence provides a mechanism for understanding how language contact can trigger change. <p> We then relax the symmetry assumptions, and demonstrate that the language dynami- cal equation can exhibit oscillations and chaos. Such behavior is consistent with the regular, spontaneous, and unpredictable changes observed in actual languages, and with the sensi- tivity exhibited by changes triggered by language contact. From there, we move to the extended model with multiple UGs. The first stage of analysis focuses on UGs that admit only a single grammar. These are stable, immune to invasion by other UGs with imperfect learning. They can invade a population that uses a similar grammar with a multi-grammar UG. This analysis suggests that in the distant past, human UG may have admitted more languages than it currently does, and that over time variants with more built-in information have taken over. Finally, we address a low-dimensional case of competition between two UGs, and find conditions where they are stable against one another, and where they can coexist. These results imply that evolution of UG must have been incremental, and that similar variants may coexist. <p> This research was conducted under the supervision of Dr. Martin A. Nowak (Program in Theoretical Biology at the Institute for Advanced Study, and Program in Applied and Computational Mathematics at Princeton University).},

	Abstract = {Universal grammar (UG) is a list of innate constraints that specify the set of grammars that can be learned by the child during primary language acquisition. UG of the human brain has been shaped by evolution. Evolution requires variation. Hence, we have to postulate and study variation of UG. We investigate evolutionary dynamics and language acquisition in the context of multiple UGs. We provide examples for competitive exclusion and stable coexistence of different UGs. More specific UGs admit fewer candidate grammars, and less specific UGs admit more candidate grammars. We will analyze conditions for more specific UGs to outcompete less specific UGs and vice versa. An interesting finding is that less specific UGs can resist invasion by more specific UGs if learning is more accurate. In other words, accurate learning stabilizes UGs that admit large numbers of candidate grammars.},

@article{moldoveanu02languageGames,
	Abstract = {How do social values come about and gain legitimacy? Starting from the premise that discourses of social analysis affect the ways in which social norms develop and proliferate, this article models the evolution of professional codes and dialects using Wittgenstein's idea of a language game. A language game is formalized as a repeated game of tacit coordination played among participants with informational asymmetries. The informational asymmetries model the different meanings that people assign to the same word used in a conversation. A language is formalized as a code that emerges as a result of repeated interactions in a language game. The paper argues that certain codes--such as those based on the real number system--lead to more reliable strategies in language games. The result is used to argue that professional dialects based on axiomatizable codes--such as physics, mathematics and economics--are less likely to experience fragmentation into intra-disciplinary 'sects,' camps and incommensurable paradigms than are professional dialects that are not based on an axiomatizable code--such as sociology, psychology, organization studies, and strategic management studies. The idea of a language game is extended to explore ways in which certain disciplines can establish cognitive jurisdiction over particular phenomena, starting from a particular set of codes, and thereby claim 'cognitive monopolies.' A rudimentary theory of the market for ideas is advanced.},

More recently the phenomena have been associated almost exclusively with the intense and pervasive economic globalization of same period, a process that some authors have reduced too easily to the McDonaldization phenomenon. Moreover, the relation of globalization to different forms of colonization has been poorly articulated. As a matter of fact, little of the longer history of population movements and contacts since the dawn of agriculture has been invoked in the literature on language endangerment to give some broader perspective on the mechanisms of language birth and death and on the ecological factors that bear on how they proceed. This review aims to remedy these shortcomings in our scholarship.},

@article{mufwene02selection,
	Abstract = {The primary thesis of this paper is that selection plays a role in language evolution. Underlying this position is the assumption that a language is a Lamarckian species, a construct extrapolated from idiolects spoken by individuals who acknowledge using the same verbal code to communicate with each other. There is no perfect replication in any case of language ``acquisition'', which is actually a recreation process in which the learner makes a system out of features selected from utterances of different individuals with whom he/she has interacted. In a way similar to gene recombination in biology, each learner gradually and selectively reintegrates into new system features which are often modified in the process. At the population level, the congruence of some divergent idiolectal selections is often strong enough for a language to evolve into a new communal system. A fundamental question for my hypothesis is: What principles regulate selection? I also assume hybridism in language ``transmission'', which is polyploidic, as features of every idiolect originate not only in various competing idiolects, but possibly also in different dialects or languages in contact. The question about feature selection remains the same.},

	Abstract = {The Baldwin effect has been explicitly used by Pinker and Bloom as an explanation of the origins of language and the evolution of a language acquisition device. This article presents new simulations of an artificial life model for the evolution of compositional languages. It specifically addresses the role of cultural variation and of learning costs in the Baldwin effect for the evolution of language. Results show that when a high cost is associated with language learning, agents gradually assimilate in their genome some explicit features (e.g., lexical properties) of the specific language they are exposed to. When the structure of the language is allowed to vary through cultural transmission, Baldwinian processes cause, instead, the assimilation of a predisposition to learn, rather than any structural properties associated with a specific language. The analysis of the mechanisms underlying such a predisposition in terms of categorical perception supports Deacon's hypothesis regarding the Baldwinian inheritance of general underlying cognitive capabilities that serve language acquisition. This is in opposition to the thesis that argues for assimilation of structural properties needed for the specification of a full-blown language acquisition device.},

We assume a situation that memoryless learners are exposed to a number of languages. We show experimental results, in which contact with other language speakers during acquisition period deteriorates the learning accuracy and prevents the emergence of a dominant language. If we suppose a communicative language, when learners are frequently exposed to a variety of languages, the language earns relatively higher rate of population.

The proposal of evolutionary equations is a modification of the language dynamics equations by Komarova et al. We show experimental results, in which we could observe the emergence of creole. Furthermore, we analyze the condition of creolization in terms of similarity among languages. We conclude that a creole becomes dominant when pre-existing languages are not similar to each other and rather similar to the newly appeared language (would-be-creole); however the new language must not be too similar, in which case pre-existing languages remain and coexist.},

	Abstract = {Language is often thought of as the crowning human adaptation, the one that allowed Homo sapiens sapiens to conquer the globe. The assumption underlying such ideas is that verbal transmission of information provides unalloyed benefits, by reducing the costs of learning about the environment. However, this raises the question of why no other species has discovered such a good trick. I argue that verbal transmission is only likely to be adaptive in a restricted range of circumstances. Even then, it cannot be exclusively relied on, and it causes problems of deceit and instances of maladaptation. We should expect natural selection to have made us discriminating evaluators of verbal information who ultimately trust the evidence of our senses. Nonetheless, once language has become widespread, it can increase human adaptability, by increasing the efficiency of individual learning.},

In this framework, the language learner samples the speech of individuals from right across his speech community, though he may weight their input differentially according to their social position. This conceptualisation is argued to be more realistic than that provided by other models. Computer simulations are used to investigate the effects on language change of different social structures and biases in language acquisition. From the results of these simulations, it is argued that the fundamental engine driving language change is the combination of inherent variation in language acquisition and differences between individuals in local social influence. Functional biases attaching to different linguistic variants influence the direction of language change.},

@article{nettle98languageDiversity,
	Abstract = {The six and a half thousand languages spoken by humankind are very unevenly distributed across the globe. Language diversity generally increases as one moves from the poles toward the equator and is very low in arid environments. Two belts of extremely high language diversity can be identified. One runs through West and Central Africa, while the other covers South and South-East Asia and the Pacific. Most of the world's languages are found in these two areas. This paper attempts to explain aspects of the global distribution of language diversity. It is proposed that a key factor influencing it has been climatic variability. Where the climate allows continuous food production throughout the year, small groups of people can be reliably self-sufficient and so populations fragment into many small languages. Where the variability of the climate is greater, the size of social network necessary for reliable subsistence is larger, and so languages tend to be more widespread. A regression analysis relating the number of languages spoken in the major tropical countries to the variability of their climates is performed and the results support the hypothesis. The geographical patterning of languages has, however, begun to be destroyed by the spread of Eurasian diseases, Eurasian people, and the world economy.},

	Abstract = {Analysis of a linguistic atlas reveals an ecological gradient in the diversity of languages in West Africa. As one moves south from arid into lusher ecoclimatic zones, the average size of ethnolinguistic groups decreases. Various factors are considered which may have contributed to this distribution. I argue that the ethnolinguistic map is primarily a reflection of the systems of generalized exchange and mutual dependence into which people enter. It is hypothesized that such social networks function to reduce subsistence risk due to variations in the food supply. If this hypothesis is correct, the average size of ethnolinguistic groups should be inversely proportional to the degree of ecological variability they face. This prediction is tested and found to hold strongly for a large part of West Africa. There is also limited evidence of a correlation between linguistic diversity and topography. It is concluded that ecological risk has been a key historical force in West Africa and that the ethnolinguistic mosaic can be used as a valuable 'fossil record' of people's adaptive social and economic strategies.},

In this paper, we present the empirical semantics approach to inductive derivation of communication semantics that can be used to derive this emergent semantics of communication from observations. The approach comes in two complementary variants: One uses social systems theory, focusing on system expectation structures and global utility maximisation, and the other is based on symbolic interactionism, focusing on the viewpoint and utility maximisation of the individual agent. Both these frameworks make use of the insight that the most general meaning of agent utterances lies in their expectable consequences in terms of observable events, and thus they strongly demarcate themselves from traditional approaches to the semantics and pragmatics of agent communication languages.},

We exploit the insight that while language learning takes place at the individual level, language change is more properly regarded as an ensemble property that takes place at the level of populations of language learners. We show by analytical and computer simulation methods that language learning can be regarded as the driving force behind a dynamical systems account of language change. We apply this model to the specific case of historical change from Classical Portuguese to European Portuguese, demonstrating how a particular language learning model coupled with data on the differences between Classical and European Portuguese leads to specific predictions for possible language-change envelopes. The main investigative message of this paper is to show how this methodology can be applied to a specific case, that of Portuguese. The main moral underscores the individual/population difference; we show that simply because an individual will choose a particular grammar does not mean that all other grammars will be eliminated.},

@article{niyogi97evolutionaryConsequences,
	Abstract = {Linguists' intuitions about language change can be captured by a dynamical systems model derived from the dynamics of language acquisition. Rather than having to posit a separate model for diachronic change, as has sometimes been done by drawing on assumptions from population biology (cf. Cavalli-Sforza and Feldman, 1973; 1981; Kroch, 1990), this new model dispenses with these independent assumptions by showing how the behavior of individual language learners leads to emergent, global population characteristics of linguistic communities over several generations. As the simplest case, we formalize the example of two grammars and show that even this situation leads directly to a nonlinear (quadratic) dynamical system. We study this one parameter model in a variety of situations for different kinds of acquisition algorithms and maturational times, showing how different learning theories can have very different evolutionary consequences. This allows us to formulate an evolutionary criterion for the adequacy of grammatical and learning theories. An application of the computational model to the historical loss of Verb Second from Old French to Modern French is described showing how otherwise adequate grammatical theories might fail the evolutionary criterion.},

	Abstract = {This paper shows how to formally characterize language learning in a finite parameter space, for instance, in the principles-and-parameters approach to language, as a Markov structure. New language learning results follow directly; we can explicitly calculate how many positive examples on average (``sample complexity'') it will take for a learner to correctly identify a target language with high probability. We show how sample complexity varies with input distributions and learning regimes. In particular we find that the average time to converge under reasonable language input distributions for a simple three-parameter system first described by Gibson and Wexler (1994) is psychologically plausible, in the range of 100-150 positive examples. We further find that a simple random step algorithm - that is, simply jumping from one language hypothesis to another rather than changing one parameter at a time - works faster and always converges to the right target language, in contrast to the single-step, local parameter setting method advocated in some recent work.},

	Abstract = {This paper considers the problem of language change. Linguists must explain not only how languages are learned but also how and why they have evolved along certain trajectories and not others. While the language learning problem has focused on the behavior of individuals and how they acquire a particular grammar from a class of grammars $cal G$, here we consider a population of such learners and investigate the emergent, global population characteristics of linguistic communities over several generations. We argue that language change follows logically from specific assumptions about grammatical theories and learning paradigms. In particular, we are able to transform parameterized theories and memoryless acquisition algorithms into grammatical dynamical systems, whose evolution depicts a population's evolving linguistic composition. We investigate the linguistic and computational consequences of this model, showing that the formalization allows one to ask questions about diachronic that one otherwise could not ask, such as the effect of varying initial conditions on the resulting diachronic trajectories. From a more programmatic perspective, we give an example of how the dynamical system model for language change can serve as a way to distinguish among alternative grammatical theories, introducing a formal diachronic adequacy criterion for linguistic theories},

@phdthesis{noble98theEvolution,
	Abstract = {Simulated evolution is used as a tool for investigating the selective pressures that have influenced the design of animal signalling systems. The biological literature on communication is first reviewed: central concepts such as the handicap principle and the view of signalling as manipulation are discussed. The equation of ``biological function'' with ``adaptive value'' is then defended, along with a workable definition of communication. Evolutionary simulation models are advocated as a way of testing the coherence of a given theory. Contra some ALife enthusiasts, simulations are not alternate worlds worthy of independent study; in fact they fit naturally into a Quinean picture of scientific knowledge as a web of modifiable propositions. Existing simulation work on the evolution of communication is reviewed: much of it consists of simple proofs of concept that fail to make connections with existing theory. A particular model (MacLennan and Burghardt, 1994) of the evolution of referential communication in a co-operative context is replicated and critiqued in detail. <p> Evolutionary simulations are then presented that cover a range of ecological scenarios; the first is a general model of food- and alarm-calling. In such situations signallers and receivers can have common or conflicting interests; the model allows us to test the idea that a conflict of interests will lead to an arms race of ever more costly signals, whereas common interests will result in signals that are as cheap as possible. The second model is concerned with communication during aggressive interactions. Many animals use signals to settle contests, thus avoiding the costs associated with fighting. Conventional game-theoretic results suggest that the signalling of aggression or of strength will not be evolutionarily stable unless it is physically unfakeable, but some recent models imply that cost-free, arbitrary signals can be reliable indicators of both intent and ability. The simulation, which features continuous-time perception of the opponent's strategy, is an attempt to settle the question. The third model deals with sexual signalling, i.e., elaborate displays that are designed to persuade members of the opposite sex to mate. The results clarify the question of whether such displays are the pointless result of runaway sexual selection, or whether they function as honest and costly indicators of genetic quality. <p> The models predict the evolution of reliable communication in a surprisingly narrow range of circumstances; a serious gap remains between these predictions and the ethological data. Future directions for simulation work are discussed.},

@article{noll03digitalOrigin,
	Abstract = {The fact that all languages known are digital poses the question of their origin. The answer developed here treats language as the interface of information theory and molecular development by showing previously unrecognized isomorphisms between the analog and digital features of language and life at the molecular level. Human language is a special case of signal transduction and hence is subject to the coding aspects of Shannon's theorems and the analog aspects of pattern recognition, each represented by genotype and phenotype. Digital language acquisition is late in evolution and postnatal development and requires a neural reorganization by a mechanism of somatic network programming in response to the environment. Such a mechanism would solve the Chomsky conundrum of how children can learn any language without knowing rules of grammar too numerous to be encoded genotypically. BioEssays},

@article{nowak99theEvolution,
	Abstract = {The emergence of language was a defining moment in the evolution of modern humans. It was an innovation that changed radically the character of human society. Here, we provide an approach to language evolution based on evolutionary game theory. We explore the ways in which protolanguages can evolve in a nonlinguistic society and how specific signals can become associated with specific objects. We assume that early in the evolution of language, errors in signaling and perception would be common. We model the probability of misunderstanding a signal and show that this limits the number of objects that can be described by a protolanguage. This 'error limit' is not overcome by employing more sounds but by combining a small set of more easily distinguishable sounds into words. The process of 'word formation' enables a language to encode an essentially unlimited number of objects. Next, we analyze how words can be combined into sentences and specify the conditions for the evolution of very simple grammatical rules. We argue that grammar originated as a simplified rule system that evolved by natural selection to reduce mistakes in communication. Our theory provides a systematic approach for thinking about the origin and evolution of human language.},

@article{nowak99anError,
	Abstract = {On the evolutionary trajectory that led to human language there must have been a transition from a fairly limited to an essentially unlimited communication system. The structure of modern human languages reveals at least two steps that are required for such a transition: in all languages (i) a small number of phonemes are used to generate a large number of words; and (ii) a large number of words are used to a produce an unlimited number of sentences. The first (and simpler) step is the topic of the current paper. We study the evolution of communication in the presence of errors and show that this limits the number of objects (or concepts) that can be described by a simple communication system. The evolutionary optimum is achieved by using only a small number of signals to describe a few valuable concepts. Adding more signals does not increase the fitness of a language. This represents an error limit for the evolution of communication. We show that this error limit can be overcome by combining signals (phonemes) into words. The transition from an analogue to a digital system was a necessary step toward the evolution of human language.},

@article{nowak00theEvolution,
	Abstract = {Animal communication is typically non-syntactic, which means that signals refer to whole situations. Human language is syntactic, and signals consist of discrete components that have their own meaning. Syntax is a prerequisite for taking advantage of combinatorics, that is, 'making infinite use of finite means'. The vast expressive power of human language would be impossible without syntax, and the transition from non-syntactic to syntactic communication was an essential step in the evolution of human language. We aim to understand the evolutionary dynamics of this transition and to analyse how natural selection can guide it. Here we present a model for the population dynamics of language evolution, define the basic reproductive ratio of words and calculate the maximum size of a lexicon. Syntax allows larger repertoires and the possibility to formulate messages that have not been learned beforehand. Nevertheless, according to our model natural selection can only favour the emergence of syntax if the number of required signals exceeds a threshold value. This result might explain why only humans evolved syntactic communication and hence complex language.},

In particular, we are interested in the evolution of vocabulary, that is associations between signals and objects. We assume that successful communication contributes to biological fitness: individuals who communicate well leave more offspring. Children inherit from their parents a strategy for language learning (a language acquisition device). We consider three mechanisms whereby language is passed from one generation to the next: (i) parental learning: children learn the language of their parents; (ii) role model learning: children learn the language of individuals with a high payoff; and (iii) random learning: children learn the language of randomly chosen individuals. We show that parental and role model learning outperform random learning. Then we introduce mistakes in language learning and study how this process changes language over time. Mistakes increase the overall efficacy of parental and role model learning: in a world with errors evolutionary adaptation is more efficient. Our model also provides a simple explanation why homonomy is common while synonymy is rare.},

	Abstract = {Much debate has been stimulated by the recent hypothesis that human language consists of a faculty that is shared with non-human animals (faculty of language in a broad sense; FLB) and a faculty that is specific to human language (faculty of language in a narrow sense; FLN). This hypothesis has encouraged a tendency to emphasize one component of FLN: the cognitive operation of recursion. In consequence, non-syntactical, yet unique, aspects of human language have been neglected. One of these properties consists of vocal learning that enables an abundance of learned syllables. I suggest that FLN is not an independent faculty, but an 'emergent' property, arising from interactions between several other non-syntactical subfaculties of FLB, including vocal learning ability.},

In particular, I argue that human language is the only existing system of learned arbitrary reference. While innate communication systems are, by definition, directly transmitted genetically, the transmission of a learned systems must be indirect. Learners must acquire the system by being exposed its the use in the community. Although it is reasonable that a learner has access to the utterances that are produced, it is less clear how accessible the meaning is that the utterance is intended to convey. This particularly problematic if the system of communication is symbolic -- where form and meaning are linked in a purely conventional way. Given this, I propose that the ability to transmit a learned symbolic system of communication from one generation to the next represents a key milestone in the evolution of language.},

@article{oliphant99theLearning,
	Abstract = {Human language is a unique ability. It sits apart from other systems of communication in two striking ways: it is syntactic, and it is learned. While most approaches to the evolution of language have focused on the evolution of syntax, this paper explores the computational issues that arise in shifting from a simple innate communication system to an equally simple one that is learned. Associative network learning within an observational learning paradigm is used to explore the computational difficulties involved in establishing and maintaining a simple learned communication system. Because Hebbian learning is found to be sufficient for this task, it is proposed that the basic computational demands of learning are unlikely to account for the rarity of even simple learned communication systems. Instead, it is the problem of *observing* that is likely to be central -- in particular the problem of determining what meaning a signal is intended to convey.},

@phdthesis{oliphant97formalApproaches,
	Abstract = {This dissertation identifies the conditions necessary to establish a system of communication in a population of individuals, whether through evolution or learning. A definition of communication is proposed that encompasses the behavior of species ranging from flowers to human beings, and a formal framework for modeling such behavior is presented. Through the use of computational simulations, it is shown that systems of communication evolve in cases where such behavior conveys a selective advantage to both sender and receiver. It is also demonstrated that factors such as kin selection and reciprocal altruism can result in the establishment of communication even when there is no direct pressure on the transmission of signals. In the case of learned communication, it is argued that observational learning is the appropriate learning model. Learning strategies that simply imitate the behavior of others, however, are not suitable. Instead, a learning mechanism must optimize its behavior so as best to communicate with the population it is observing. A Bayesian learning procedure designed to maximize the probability of communicative success is shown to be capable not only of learning an existing communication system, but also constructing such a system from random initial signaling behavior. To examine how animals might actually implement such a procedure, network learning models are considered. It is shown that a simple form of Hebbian learning, well within the grasp of most animals, has the required properties. Given this, it is surprising that learned systems of communication are not more frequent. Evidence from the animal social learning literature suggests that the primary reason for this may be that observational learning is difficult, if not impossible, for non-human animals. Given this, he most basic explanation for why only humans have language may not lie in the ability of learn a complex, syntactic form of communication, but rather in the ability to learn any system of communication at all.},

@article{oliphant96theDilemma,
	Abstract = {A Saussurean communication system exists when an entire communicating population uses a single ``language'' that maps states unambiguously onto symbols and then back into the original states. This paper describes a number of simulations performed with a genetic algorithm to investigate the conditions necessary for such communication systems to evolve. The first simulation shows that Saussurean communication evolves in the simple case where direct selective pressure is placed on individuals to be both good transmitters and good receivers. The second simulation demonstrates that, in the more realistic case where selective pressure is only placed on doing well as a receiver, Saussurean communication fails to evolve. Two methods, inspired by research on the Prisoner's Dilemma, are used to attempt to solve this problem. The third simulation shows that, even in the absence of selective pressure on transmission, Saussurean communication can evolve if individuals interact multiple times with the same communication partner and are given the ability to respond differentially based on past interaction. In the fourth simulation, spatially organized populations are used, and it is shown that this allows Saussurean communication to evolve through kin selection.},

@article{oliphant97learningAnd,
	Abstract = {If the members of a population of animals are to enjoy the benefit that might accrue from the exchange of information, their communicative behavior must be coordinated -- most of the time that an animal sends a signal in some type of situation, others respond to the signal in a manner appropriate to the situation that inspired it. We investigate how coordinated communication could emerge among animals capable of producing and responding to simple signals, and how such coordination could be maintained, when new members of a population learn to communicate by observing the other members. We describe a learning procedure that enables an individual to achieve the maximum possible accuracy in communicating with a given population. If all new members of the population use this procedure, or one of the approximations to it we describe, the coordination of the population's communication will steadily increase, ultimately yielding a highly coordinated system. Our results are derived mathematically from a formal model of simple communication systems. We illustrate these results with computational simulations. and discuss their biological plausibility and their relevance to more complex communication systems, including human language.},

Moreover, the human speech code is discrete and compositional, shared by all the individuals of a community but different across communities, and phoneme inventories are characterized by statistical regularities.

The mechanism is based on a low-level model of sensory-motor interactions. We show that the integration of certain very simple and non language-specific neural devices leads to the formation of a speech code that has properties similar to the human speech code. This result relies on the self-organizing properties of a generic coupling between perception and production within agents, and on the interactions between agents.

A computational model of the cultural formation of syllable systems illustrates how general learning and physical biases can influence the evolution of the structure of vocalization systems. We use the artificial life methodology of building a society of artificial agents, equipped with motor, perceptual and cognitive systems that are generic and have a realistic complexity. We demonstrate that agents, playing the ''imitation game,'' build shared syllable systems and show how these syllable systems relate to existing human syllable systems. Detailed experiments study the learnability of the self-organized syllable systems. In particular, we reproduce the critical period effect and the artificial language learning effect without the need for innate biases which specify explicitly in advance the form of possible phonological structures. The ability of children agents to learn syllable systems is explained by the cultural evolutionary history of these syllable systems, which were selected for learnability.},

	Abstract = {Sound is a medium used by humans to carry information. The existence of this kind of medium is a pre-requisite for language. It is organized into a code, called speech, which provides a repertoire of forms that is shared in each language community. This code is necessary to support the linguistic interactions that allow humans to communicate. How then may a speech code be formed prior to the existence of linguistic interactions? Moreover, the human speech code is characterized by several properties: speech is digital and compositional (vocalizations are made of units re-used systematically in other syllables); phoneme inventories have precise regularities as well as great diversity in human languages; all the speakers of a language community categorize sounds in the same manner, but each language has its own system of categorization, possibly very different from every other. How can a speech code with these properties form? These are the questions we will approach in the paper. We will study them using the method of the artificial. We will build a society of artificial agents, and study what mechanisms may provide answers. This will not prove directly what mechanisms were used for humans, but rather give ideas about what kind of mechanism may have been used. This allows us to shape the search space of possible answers, in particular by showing what is sufficient and what is not necessary. The mechanism we present is based on a low-level model of sensorymotor interactions. We show that the integration of certain very simple and non language-specific neural devices allows a population of agents to build a speech code that has the properties mentioned above. The originality is that it pre-supposes neither a functional pressure for communication, nor the ability to have coordinated social interactions (they do not play language or imitation games).

The originality of the system is that: (1) it does not include any explicit pressure for communication; (2) agents do not possess capabilities of coordinated interactions, in particular they do not play language games; (3) agents possess no specific linguistic capacities; and (4) initially there exists no convention that agents can use. As a consequence, the system shows how a primitive speech code may bootstrap in the absence of a communication system between agents, i.e. before the appearance of language.},

	Abstract = {This paper presents algorithms that allow a robot to express its emotions by modulating the intonation of its voice. They are very simple and efficiently provide life-like speech thanks to the use of concatenative speech synthesis. We describe a technique which allows to continuously control both the age of a synthetic voice and the quantity of emotions that are expressed. Also, we present the first large-scale data mining experiment about the automatic recognition of basic emotions in informal everyday short utterances. We focus on the speaker-dependent problem. We compare a large set of machine learning algorithms, ranging from neural networks, Support Vector Machines or decision trees, together with 200 features, using a large database of several thousands examples. We show that the difference of performance among learning schemes can be substantial, and that some features which were previously unexplored are of crucial importance. An optimal feature set is derived through the use of a genetic algorithm. Finally, we explain how this study can be applied to real world situations in which very few examples are available. Furthermore, we describe a game to play with a personal robot which facilitates teaching of examples of emotional utterances in a natural and rather unconstrained manner.},

	Abstract = {This paper presents a model of the origins of syllable systems that brings plausibility to the theory which claims that language learning, and in particular phonological acquisition, needs not innate linguistically specific information, as believed by many researchers of the Chomskyan school, but is rather made possible by the interaction between general motor, perceptual, cognitive and social constraints through a self-organizing process. The strategy is to replace the question of acquisition in a larger and evolutionary (cultural) framework: the model addresses the question of the origins of syllable systems (syllables are the major phonological units in speech). It is based on the artificial life methodology of building a society of agents, endowed with motor, perceptual and cognitive apparati that are generic and realistic. We show that agents effectively build sound systems and how these sound systems relate to existing human sound systems. Results concerning the learnability of the produced sound systems by fresh/baby agents are detailed: the critical period effect and the artificial language effect can effectively be predicted by our model. The ability of children to learn sound systems is explained by the evolutionary history of these sound systems, which were precisely shaped so as to fit the ecological niche formed by the brains and bodies of these children, and not the other way around (as advocated by Chomskyan approaches to language).},

	Abstract = {Many models, computational or not, exist that describe the acquisition of speech: they all rely on the pre-existence of some sort of linguistic structure in the input, i.e. speech itself. Very few address the question of how this coherence and structure appeared. We try here to give a solution concerning syllable systems. We propose an operational model that shows how a society of robotic of agents, endowed with a set of non-linguistically specific motor, perceptual, cognitive and social constraints (some of them are obstacles whereas others are opportunities), can collectively build a coherent and structured syllable system from scratch. As opposed to many existing abstract models of the origins of language, as few shortcuts as possible were taken in the way the constraints are implemented. The structural properties of the produced sound systems are extensively studied under the light of phonetics and phonology and more broadly language theory. The model brings more plausibility in favor of theories of language that defend the idea that there needs no innate linguistic specific abilities to explain observed regularities in world languages.},

	Abstract = {What kind of motivation drives child language development? This article presents a computational model and a robotic experiment to articulate the hypothesis that children discover communication as a result of exploring and playing with their environment. The considered robotic agent is intrinsically motivated towards situations in which it optimally progresses in learning. To experience optimal learning progress, it must avoid situations already familiar but also situations where nothing can be learnt. The robot is placed in an environment in which both communicating and non-communicating objects are present. As a consequence of its intrinsic motivation, the robot explores this environment in an organized manner focusing first on non-communicative activities and then discovering the learning potential of certain types of interactive behaviour. In this experiment, the agent ends up being interested by communication through vocal interactions without having a specific drive for communication.},

They clearly are not born, however, with fully developed grammars. Thus early language development involves refinement of the grammar hypothesis until a target grammar is learnt. Here we address the question of how much evidence is required for this refinement process, by considering two standard learning algorithms and a third algorithm which is presumably as efficient as a child for some value of its memory capacity. We reformulate this algorithm in the context of Chomsky's 'principles and parameters' and show that it is possible to bound the amount of evidence required to almost certainly speak almost grammatically.},

@article{pagel07wordFrequencyNATURE,
	Abstract = {Greek speakers say 'omicronupsilonrho', Germans 'schwanz' and the French 'queue' to describe what English speakers call a 'tail', but all of these languages use a related form of 'two' to describe the number after one. Among more than 100 Indo-European languages and dialects, the words for some meanings (such as 'tail') evolve rapidly, being expressed across languages by dozens of unrelated words, while others evolve much more slowly--such as the number 'two', for which all Indo-European language speakers use the same related word-form. No general linguistic mechanism has been advanced to explain this striking variation in rates of lexical replacement among meanings. Here we use four large and divergent language corpora (English, Spanish, Russian and Greek) and a comparative database of 200 fundamental vocabulary meanings in 87 Indo-European languages to show that the frequency with which these words are used in modern language predicts their rate of replacement over thousands of years of Indo-European language evolution. Across all 200 meanings, frequently used words evolve at slower rates and infrequently used words evolve more rapidly. This relationship holds separately and identically across parts of speech for each of the four language corpora, and accounts for approximately 50\% of the variation in historical rates of lexical replacement. We propose that the frequency with which specific words are used in everyday language exerts a general and law-like influence on their rates of evolution. Our findings are consistent with social models of word change that emphasize the role of selection, and suggest that owing to the ways that humans use language, some words will evolve slowly and others rapidly across all languages.},

	Abstract = {The aim of the paper is to show that an Artificial Life approach to language tends to change the research agenda on language which has been shared by both the symbolic paradigm and classical connectionism. Artificial Life Neural Networks (ALNNs) are different from classical connectionist networks because they interact with an independent physical environment; are subject to evolutionary, developmental, and cultural change, and not only to learning; and are part of organisms that have a physical body, have a life (are born, develop, and die), and are members of genetic and, sometimes, cultural populations. Using ALNNs to study language shifts the emphasis from research on linguistic forms and laboratory-like tasks to the investigation of the emergence and transmission of language, the use of language, its role in cognition, and language as a populational rather than as an individual phenomenon.},

In this paper, following a critical analysis of what is meant by the term, I examine three reasons why the recursion-only hypothesis cannot be correct: (i) recursion is neither unique to language in humans, nor unique to our species, (ii) human language consists of many properties which are unique to it, and independent of recursion, and (iii) recursion may not even be necessary to human communication. Consequently, if recursion is not the key defining property of human language, it should not be granted special status in an evolutionary account of the system.},

	Abstract = {This thesis investigates the evolutionary plausibility of the Minimalist Program. Is such a theory of language reasonable given the assumption that the human linguistic capacity has been subject to the usual forces and processes of evolution? More generally, this thesis is a comment on the manner in which theories of language can and should be constrained. What are the constraints that must be taken into account when constructing a theory of language? These questions are addressed by applying evidence gathered in evolutionary biology to data from linguistics. <p> The development of generative syntactic theorising in the late 20th century has led to a much redesigned conception of the human language faculty. The driving question - `why is language the way it is?' - has prompted assumptions of simplicity, perfection, optimality, and economy for language; a minimal system operating in an economic fashion to fit into the larger cognitive architecture in a perfect manner. Studies in evolutionary linguistics, on the other hand, have been keen to demonstrate that language is complex, redundant, and adaptive, Pinker & Bloom's (1990) seminal paper being perhaps the prime example of this. The question is whether these opposing views can be married in any way. <p> Interdisciplinary evidence is brought to bear on this problem, demonstrating that any reconciliation is impossible. Evolutionary biology shows that perfection, simplicity, and economy do not arise in typically evolving systems, yet the Minimalist Program attaches these characteristics to language. It shows that evolvable systems exhibit degeneracy, modularity, and robustness, yet the Minimalist Programmust rule these features out for language. It shows that evolution exhibits a trend towards complexity, yet the Minimalist Program excludes such a depiction of language. <p> By determining where language falls in each of these three cases, the choice between the opposing positions of gradual adaptive evolution and the Minimalist Program is resolved. Language is shown to be imperfect, uneconomic, and non-optimal, and hence a typical biological system. Language is shown to exhibit the key features of evolvability, and hence accords with the usual pressures and constraints of evolution. Language is shown to be both complex and adaptive, and hence amenable to a gradual adaptive evolutionary account. <p> In addition, the uniqueness of the pivotal property of language according to one minimalist evolutionary account -- recursion -- is examined, its place as just one of a collection of properties which make language special illustrating that language is significantly more complex and sophisticated than the Minimalist Program allows. Finally, significant flaws in the details of minimalist theories themselves -- including extraneous operations, and unmotivated and stipulative features -- are uncovered, further signalling that the perfection, simplicity, and economy that minimalism advocates is not a valid characterisation of language.},

A proto-language can be seen as a collection of concept-to-sign mappings. An efficient proto-language is a bijective mapping from objects of communication to used signs and vice versa. Based on the comparison of fixation probabilities, a method for deriving conditions of evolutionary stability in a finite population [Nowak et al., 2004.

@phdthesis{petrova01theEvolution,
	Abstract = {This dissertation provides an Optimality-Theoretic (OT: Prince & Smolensky 1993, McCarthy & Prince 1993) account of the evolution of the English obstruent inventory over an extended period of time, starting with Proto-Indo-European and ending with Early New English. By modeling the mechanism through which the PIE [voice] distinction in stops emerged as a Germanic [spread glottis] distinction, the analysis lends support to a recently established claim that [spread glottis], rather than [voice], is distinctive in stops in the majority of the Germanic languages (Iverson & Salmons 1995, Jessen 1998) OT, a non-derivational framework which provides a model of Universal Grammar (UG) significantly different from the earlier rule-based approaches, views language change as the reranking of hierarchically organized UG constraints on the well-formedness of output representations (Cho 1995, Berm{\oe}dez-Otero 1995). The non-serial essence of OT makes it possible to describe parallel sound shifts, whereby a number of sound changes occur in parallel, rather than sequentially. For example, in Grimm's Law, p-b shifts to psg-p, whereby the contrast is preserved, yet it is has a different segmental composition. Specifically, it is demonstrated that a comprehensive analysis of language change, and, especially, parallel sound shifts, calls for the integration of two complementary approaches within OT: faithfulness (McCarthy & Prince 1995, and others) and dispersion (Flemming 1996, Padgett 1997). In the faithfulness framework, language change is viewed as a resolution of the conflict between the tendency to save articulatory effort and the preference for the faithful mapping of input representations to their output correspondents. In the dispersion framework, language change results from the conflict between articulatory effort minimization and the preference for a maximal perceptual contrast among output forms, with no reference to inputs. In more general terms, the dispersion interaction reflects the tendency to maintain a balanced inventory, whereas a faithfulness interaction implements the preference for a transparent (i.e., non-structure changing) inventory. The integration of the two approaches amounts to claiming that each individual output form experiences two competing pressures: to be different from or similar to other output forms, and to be identical to a corresponding input form. Unlike the proponents of the dispersion-based approach (e.g., Flemming 1998), who contend that the two approaches are incompatible, I demonstrate that dispersion and faithfulness are not only compatible, but complementary in accounting for language change. Dispersion constraints exercise a stabilizing effect on the inventory. By enforcing a fixed number of contrasts, the dispersion interaction thereby delimits the range of (or censors) possible faithfulness violations. The faithfulness constraints complement the dispersion interaction, by referring to an input as the reference point relative to which the output contrast is evaluated, so that the contrast which is minimally unfaithful to the input is selected as optimal. In other words, whereas dispersion is responsible for enforcing contrast itself, faithfulness is in charge of determining the adequate segmental composition of the contrast. The analysis reveals that the integrated dispersion/faithfulness framework has advantages over earlier linguistic approaches in accounting for the sound changes which have a perceptual origin, such as Grimm's Law and Verner's Law.},

(1988), the spread of anatomically modern man was reconstructed on the basis of genetic and linguistic pieces of evidence: the main conclusion was that these two approaches reflect a common underlying history, the history of our past still frozen in the genes of modern populations. The expression `genetic history' was introduced (Piazza et al. 1988) to point out that if today we find many genes showing the same geographical patterns in terms of their frequencies, this may be due to the common history of our species. A deeper exploration of the whole problem can be found in Cavalli-Sforza et al. (1994). In the following, some specific cases of structural analogies between linguistic and genetic geographical patterns will be explored that supply further and more updated information. It is important to emphasize at the outset that evidence for coevolution of genes and languages in human populations does not suggest by itself that some genes of our species determine the way we speak; this coevolution may simply be due to a common mode of transmission and mutation of genetic and linguistic units of information and common constraints of demographic factors.},

	Abstract = {The majority of studies on animal communication provide evidence that gestural signaling plays an important role in the communication of nonhuman primates and resembles that of pre-linguistic and just-linguistic human infants in some important ways. However, ape gestures also differ from the gestures of human infants in some important ways as well, and these differences might provide crucial clues for answering the question of how human language -- at least in its cognitive and social-cognitive aspects- evolved from the gestural communication of our ape-like ancestors. The present manuscript summarizes and compares recent studies on the gestural signaling of the great apes (Gorilla gorilla, Pan paniscus, Pan troglodytes, Pongo pygmaeus) to enable a comparison with gestures in children. We focused on the three following aspects: 1) nature of gestures, 2) intentional use of gestures, 3) and learning of gestures. Our results show, that apes have multifaceted gestural repertoires and use their gestures intentionally. Although some group-specific gestures seem to be acquired via a social learning process, the majority of gestures are learned via individual learning. Importantly, all of the intentional produced gestures share two important characteristics that make them crucially different from human deictic and symbolic gestures: 1) they are almost invariably used in dyadic contexts and 2) they are used exclusively for imperative purposes. Implications for these differences are discussed.},

	Abstract = {In this work we study the dynamics of language competition. In Abrams and Strogatz [Modeling the dynamics of language death, Nature 424 (2003) 900], the extinction of one of the competing languages is predicted, although in some case the coexistence occurs. The preservation of both languages was explained by Patriarca and Leppanen [Modeling language competition, Physica A 338 (2004) 296] by introducing the existence of two disjoint zones where each language is predominant. However, their results cannot explain the survivance of both languages in only one zone of competition. In this work we discuss their results and propose a new alternative model of Lotka-Volterra type in order to explain the coexistence of two languages.},

@article{pinker90naturalLanguage,
	Abstract = {Many people have argued that the evolution of the human language faculty cannot be explained by Darwinian natural selection. Chomsky and Gould have suggested that language may have evolved as the by-product of selection for other abilities or as a consequence of as-yet unknown laws of growth and form. Others have argued that a biological specialization for grammar is incompatible with every tenet of Darwinian theory -- that it shows no genetic variation, could not exist in any intermediate forms, confers no selective advantage, and would require more evolutionary time and genomic space than is available. We examine these arguments and show that they depend on inaccurate assumptions about biology or language or both. Evolutionary theory offers clear criteria for when a trait should be attributed to natural selection: complex design for some function, and the absence of alternative processes capable of explaining such complexity. Human language meets this criterion: grammar is a complex mechanism tailored to the transmission of propositional structures through a serial interface. Autonomous and arbitrary grammatical phenomena have been offered as counterexamples to the position that language is an adaptation, but this reasoning is unsound: communication protocols depend on arbitrary conventions that are adaptive as long as they are shared. Consequently, language acquisition in the child should systematically differ from language evolution in the species and attempts to analogize them are misleading. Reviewing other arguments and data, we conclude that there is every reason to believe that a specialization for grammar evolved by a conventional neo-Darwinian process.},

@article{pinker_jackendoff,
	Abstract = {We examine the question of which aspects of language are uniquely human and uniquely linguistic in light of recent suggestions by Hauser, Chomsky, and Fitch that the only such aspect is syntactic recursion, the rest of language being either specific to humans but not to language (e.g. words and concepts) or not specific to humans (e.g. speech perception). We find the hypothesis problematic. It ignores the many aspects of grammar that are not recursive, such as phonology, morphology, case, agreement, and many properties of words. It is inconsistent with the anatomy and neural control of the human vocal tract. And it is weakened by experiments suggesting that speech perception cannot be reduced to primate audition, that word learning cannot be reduced to fact learning, and that at least one gene involved in speech and language was evolutionarily selected in the human lineage but is not specific to recursion. The recursion-only claim, we suggest, is motivated by Chomsky's recent approach to syntax, the Minimalist Program, which de-emphasizes the same aspects of language. The approach, however, is sufficiently problematic that it cannot be used to support claims about evolution. We contest related arguments that language is not an adaptation, namely that it is 'perfect,' non-redundant, unusable in any partial form, and badly designed for communication. The hypothesis that language is a complex adaptation for communication which evolved piecemeal avoids all these problems.},

The present study aimed to contrast brachiomanual gestures with orofacial movements and vocalizations in the natural communication of our closest primate relatives, bonobos (Pan paniscus) and chimpanzees (Pan troglodytes). We tested whether gesture is the more flexible form of communication by measuring the strength of association between signals and specific behavioral contexts, comparing groups of both the same and different ape species. Subjects were two captive bonobo groups, a total of 13 individuals, and two captive chimpanzee groups, a total of 34 individuals. The study distinguished 31 manual gestures and 18 facial/vocal signals. It was found that homologous facial/vocal displays were used very similarly by both ape species, yet the same did not apply to gestures. Both within and between species gesture usage varied enormously. Moreover, bonobos showed greater flexibility in this regard than chimpanzees and were also the only species in which multimodal communication (i.e., combinations of gestures and facial/vocal signals) added to behavioral impact on the recipient.},

	Abstract = {This paper argues that the evolution of human language is a prerequisite to the evolution of human morality. Human moral systems are not possible without fully complex language. Though protolanguage can extend moral systems, the design features of human language greatly extend human moral ability. Specifically, this paper focuses on how recursion, linguistic creativity, naming ability, displacement, and compositionality extend moral systems. The argument descriptively defines altruism as self-sacrificial behavior for others and morality as how a group classifies right and wrong behavior. No comment is made on how altruism squares with the replicatory selfishness of genes, or on the controversy of group selection. However, along with Dawkins (Dawkins, 1976), the author concurs that humans can use linguistically based concepts to help constrain genetic selfishness and promote degrees of altruism and morality. Though drawing on previous research, the ideas presented here are novel to the extent that they demonstrate how the design features of language support and extend human altruism and morality.},

@phdthesis{poulshock,
	Abstract = {This thesis inquires into how human language relates to morality -- and shows the ways language enables, extends, and maintains human value systems. Though we ultimately need to view the relation between language and morality from many different perspectives -- biological, psychological, sociological, and philosophical -- the approach here is primarily a linguistic one informed by evolutionary theory. <p> At first, this study shows how natural selection relates to the problem of altruism and how language serves human moral ontogeny. Subsequently, the argument demonstrates how language helps enable cultural group selection. Moreover, as language helps influence human behavior in an altruistic direction beyond in-group non-kin (helping facilitate cultural group selection), we also consider how language can help facilitate altruistic behavior towards out-group non-kin. This therefore raises the prospect of a limited moral realism in a world of evolutionary processes. <p> With these issues and possibilities in mind, we consider and analyze the properties of language that help extend human morality. Specifically, discussion covers how recursion, linguistic creativity, naming ability, displacement, stimulus freedom, compositionality, cultural transmission, and categorization extend moral systems. Moreover, because language so broadly influences morality, the inquiry extends into how linguistic differences (specifically between English and Japanese) might also cause subtle differences in moral perception between Japanese and English speakers. <p> Lastly, we consider how moral ideas might take on a life of their own, catalytically propagating in degrees dependent and independent of human intention. That is, we consider how ideas might become memetic. After considering the serious problems of memetics, this approach employs a linguistic version of memetic theory and considers how psychological, social, and linguistic constraints may cause moral memes to attain a memetic state and spread by an independent or semi-independent replicator dynamic. Thus, some moral ideas that we possess through language may actually possess us.},

@inproceedings{quinn01evolvingCommunication,
	Abstract = {Artificial Life models have consistently implemented communication as an exchange of signals over dedicated and functionally isolated channels. I argue that such a feature prevents models from providing a satisfactory account of the origins of communication and present a model in which there are no dedicated channels. Agents controlled by neural networks and equipped with proximity sensors and wheels are presented with a co-ordinated movement task. It is observed that functional, but non-communicative, behaviours which evolve in the early stages of the simulation both make possible, and form the basis of, the communicative behaviour which subsequently evolves.},

@article{ramus00languageDiscrimination,
	Abstract = {Humans, but no other animal, make meaningful use of spoken language. What is unclear, however, is whether this capacity depends on a unique constellation of perceptual and neurobiological mechanisms or whether a subset of such mechanisms is shared with other organisms. To explore this problem, parallel experiments were conducted on human newborns and cotton-top tamarin monkeys to assess their ability to discriminate unfamiliar languages. A habituation-dishabituation procedure was used to show that human newborns and tamarins can discriminate sentences from Dutch and Japanese but not if the sentences are played backward. Moreover, the cues for discrimination are not present in backward speech. This suggests that the human newborns' tuning to certain properties of speech relies on general processes of the primate auditory system.},

@article{redford01constrainedEmergence,
	Abstract = {A computational model of emergent syllable systems is developed based on a set of functional constraints on syllable systems and the assumption that language structure emerges through cumulative change over time. The constraints were derived from general communicative factors as well as from the phonetic principles of perceptual distinctiveness and articulatory ease. Through evolutionary optimization, the model generated mock vocabularies optimized for the given constraints. Several simulations were run to understand how these constraints might define the emergence of universals and variation in complex sound systems. The predictions were that (1) CV syllables would be highly frequent in all vocabularies evolved under the constraints; (2) syllables with consonant clusters, consonant codas, and vowel onsets would occur much less frequently; (3) a relationship would exist between the number of syllable types in a vocabulary and the average word length in the vocabulary; (4) different syllable types would emerge according to, what we termed, an iterative principle of syllable structure and their frequency would be directly related to their complexity; and (5) categorical differences would emerge between vocabularies evolved under the same constraints. Simulation results confirmed these predictions and provided novel insights into why regularities and differences may occur across languages. Specifically, the model suggested that both language universals and variation are consistent with a set of functional constraints that are fixed relative to one another. Language universals reflect underlying constraints on the system and language variation represents the many different and equally-good solutions to the unique problem defined by these constraints.},

@inproceedings{redford98syllableSystems,
	Abstract = {In this paper we present an approach to modeling emergent syllable systems using simulated evolution of a ``vocabulary'' of ``words.'' The model is aimed at testing the general hypothesis that language-universal sound patterns emerge from selection pressures exerted on the system by the perceptual and articulatory constraints of language users. The model is able to distinguish between hypotheses about how specific, biologicallymotivated constraints affect the sound structure of language. For example, it is shown that mandibular oscillation provides a strong constraint on the sequential organization of phonemes into words. Future work will explore the potential of other constraints that, with mandibular oscillation, will be sufficient to describe the emergence of syllable systems.},

@article{reed02negotiatingThe,
	Abstract = {This article presents a formal framework and outlines a method that autonomous agents can use to negotiate the semantics of their communication language at run-time. Such an ability is needed in open multi-agent systems so that agents can ensure they understand the implications of the utterances that are being made and so that they can tailor the meaning of the primitives to best fit their prevailing circumstances. To this end, the semantic space framework provides a systematic means of classifying the primitives along multiple relevant dimensions. This classification can then be used by the agents to structure their negotiation (or semantic fixing) process so that they converge to the mutually agreeable semantics that are necessary for coherent social interactions.},

@article{reggia01conditionsEnabling,
	Abstract = {In the research described here we extend past computational investigations of animal signaling by studying an artificial world in which a population of initially noncommunicating agents evolves to communicate about food sources and predators. Signaling in this world can be either beneficial (e.g., warning of nearby predators) or costly (e.g., attracting predators or competing agents). Our goals were twofold: to examine systematically environmental conditions under which grounded signaling does or does not evolve, and to determine how variations in assumptions made about the evolutionary process influence the outcome. Among other things, we found that agents warning of nearby predators were a common occurrence whenever predators had a significant impact on survival and signaling could interfere with predator success. The setting most likely to lead to food signaling was found to be difficult-to-locate food sources that each have relatively large amounts of food. Deviations from the selection methods typically used in traditional genetic algorithms were also found to have a substantial impact on whether communication evolved. For example, constraining parent selection and child placement to physically neighboring areas facilitated evolution of signaling in general, whereas basing parent selection upon survival alone rather than survival plus fitness measured as success in food acquisition was more conducive to the emergence of predator alarm signals. We examine the mechanisms underlying these and other results, relate them to existing experimental data about animal signaling, and discuss their implications for artificial life research involving evolution of communication.},

@article{ribeiroloula07symbols,
	Abstract = {Modern semiotics is a branch of logics that formally defines symbol-based communication. In recent years, the semiotic classification of signs has been invoked to support the notion that symbols are uniquely human. Here we show that alarm-calls such as those used by African vervet monkeys (Cercopithecus aethiops), logically satisfy the semiotic definition of symbol. We also show that the acquisition of vocal symbols in vervet monkeys can be successfully simulated by a computer program based on minimal semiotic and neurobiological constraints. The simulations indicate that learning depends on the tutor-predator ratio, and that apprenticegenerated auditory mistakes in vocal symbol interpretation have little effect on the learning rates of apprentices (up to 80\% of mistakes are tolerated). In contrast, just 10\% of apprentice-generated visual mistakes in predator identification will prevent any vocal symbol to be correctly associated with a predator call in a stable manner. Tutor unreliability was also deleterious to vocal symbol learning: a mere 5\% of ``lying'' tutors were able to completely disrupt symbol learning, invariably leading to the acquisition of incorrect associations by apprentices. Our investigation corroborates the existence of vocal symbols in a non-human species, and indicates that symbolic competence emerges spontaneously from classical associative learning mechanisms when the conditioned stimuli are self-generated, arbitrary and socially efficacious. We propose that more exclusive properties of human language, such as syntax, may derive from the evolution of higher-order domains for neural association, more removed from both the sensory input and the motor output, able to support the gradual complexification of grammatical categories into syntax.},

Communication systems are ubiquitous in the natural world but vocal learning is a comparatively rare evolutionary development (Jarvis, 2004). In this paper we take one example of this phenomena, bird song, which displays some remarkable parallels with human language (Doupe \& Kuhl, 1999), and we focus on one particular case study, that of the Bengalese finch (Lonchura striata var. domestica), a domesticated species whose song behaviour differs strikingly from its feral ancestor in that it has complex syntax and is heavily influenced by early learning (Okanoya, 2002). We present a computational model of the evolutionary history of the Bengalese finch which demonstrates how an increase in song complexity and increased influence from early learning could evolve spontaneously as a result of domestication. We argue that this may provide an insight into how increased reliance on vocal learning could evolve in other communication systems, including human language.},

Transcranial magnetic stimulation and positron emission tomography (PET) experiments suggest that a mirror system for gesture recognition also exists in humans and includes Broca's area. We propose here that such an observation/execution matching system provides a necessary bridge from `doing' to `communicating', as the link between actor and observer becomes a link between the sender and the receiver of each message.},

	Abstract = {The Human Speechome Project is an effort to observe and computationally model the longitudinal course of language development for a single child at an unprecedented scale. We are collecting audio and video recordings for the first three years of one child's life, in its near entirety, as it unfolds in the child's home. A network of ceiling-mounted video cameras and microphones are generating approximately 300 gigabytes of observational data each day from the home. One of the worlds largest single-volume disk arrays is under construction to house approximately 400,000 hours of audio and video recordings that will accumulate over the three year study. To analyze the massive data set, we are developing new data mining technologies to help human analysts rapidly annotate and transcribe recordings using semi-automatic methods, and to detect and visualize salient patterns of behavior and interaction. To make sense of large-scale patterns that span across months or even years of observations, we are developing computational models of language acquisition that are able to learn from the childs experiential record. By creating and evaluating machine learning systems that step into the shoes of the child and sequentially process long stretches of perceptual experience, we will investigate possible language learning strategies used by children with an emphasis on early word learning.},

During the years of language acquisition, the brain not only stores linguistic information but also adapts to the grammatical regularities of language. Recent advances in functional neuroimaging have substantially contributed to systems-level analyses of brain development. In this Viewpoint, I review the current understanding of how the 'final state' of language acquisition is represented in the mature brain and summarize new findings on cortical plasticity for second language acquisition, focusing particularly on the function of the grammar center.},

@article{wendy05PNAS,
	Abstract = {This report contains a linguistic description of a language created spontaneously without any apparent external influence in a stable existing community. We describe the syntactic structure of Al-Sayyid Bedouin Sign Language, a language that has arisen in the last 70 years in an isolated endogamous community with a high incidence of nonsyndromic, genetically recessive, profound prelingual neurosensory deafness. In the space of one generation from its inception, systematic grammatical structure has emerged in the language. Going beyond a conventionalized list of words for actions, objects, people, characteristics, and so on, a systematic way of marking the grammatical relations among those elements has appeared in the form of highly regular word order. These systematic structures cannot be attributed to influence from other languages, because the particular word orders that appear in Al-Sayyid Bedouin Sign Language differ from those found both in the ambient spoken languages in the community and in the other sign language found predominantly in the surrounding area. Therefore, the emerging grammatical structures should be regarded as an independent development within the language.},

These facts suggest that complex song grammars may have evolved via sexual selection. How, then, do the female birds gauge a song's complexity? Assuming that they can measure the complexity of a song while communicating with a male, but without making a model of the song, we studied the evolution of song grammars. In our simulation, it was demonstrated that song grammars became more complex through communication between coevolving males and females. Furthermore, when singing and listening were subject to fluctuations, peculiar features were observed in communication and evolution.},

@article{satterfield01towardA,
	Abstract = {Creole languages are often a point of contention for theoretical linguistics. Broadly defined, creoles result from an amalgamation of two or more languages, when speakers of differing mother tongues need rudimentary communication during economic or social transactions. Creolization occurs if the invented system becomes the native language of the speech community. There are several hypotheses for how biological linguistic properties and social contact each bear on the formation of creoles; however, until recently, no reliable method for testing these complex interactions existed. Implementing SWARM 2.1.1, the current model consists of a multiagent population drawn from historical records of Surinamese sugar cane plantations. Each agent in this artificial society is endowed with a demographic profile and linguistic parameters. Three experiments using the SWARM model are described. The results provide viable motivation for advancing a sociogenetic solution for the emergence of prototypical creole languages.},

	Abstract = {Research on physical attraction is often interpreted with reference to the theory that physical attraction enables adaptive mate choice behaviour. The sensation of physical attraction is thought to enable humans to select those mates who are most likely to help them bear the fittest offspring. The sexual behaviour associated with mate choice emerges at puberty, and so the present study investigated whether adult-like judgments of facial and vocal attractiveness arise at puberty. It found that children and adolescents differ from adults in their judgments of attractive faces and voices, and that pitch of voice cues different responses in the different age groups. It also found co-variance in the attractiveness of male faces and voices, suggesting that the modalities of face and voice are providing concordant signals as to mate quality.},

@incollection{schoenemann05conceptualComplexity,
	Abstract = {The evolutionary process works by modifying pre-existing mechanisms, which makes continuity likely. A review of the evidence available to date suggests that there are many aspects of language that show evolutionary continuity, though the direct evidence for syntax and grammar is less clear. However, the universal features of grammar in modern human languages appear to be essentially descriptions of aspects of our basic conceptual universe. It is argued that the most parsimonious model of language evolution involves an increase in conceptual/semantic complexity, which in turn drove the acquisition of syntax and grammar. In this model, universal features of grammar are actually simply reflections of our internal conceptual universe, which are manifested culturally in a variety of ways that are consistent with our pre-linguistic cognitive abilities. This explains both why grammatical rules vary so much across languages, as well as the fact that the commonalities appear to be inherently semantic in nature. An understanding of the way in which concepts are instantiated in the brain, combined with a comparative perspective on brain structure/function relationships, suggest a tight relationship between increasing brain size during hominid evolution and increasing conceptual complexity. A simulation using populations of interacting artificial neural-net agents illustrating this hypothesis is described. The association of brain size and conceptual complexity suggests that language has a deep ancestry.},

	Abstract = {A set of simulations are presented that investigate generalization in languages evolved for mobile robots. The mobile robot platform is RatSLAM, a model for Simultaneous Localization and Mapping based on rodent hippocampus that uses visual and odometric information to build up a map of the explored environment. The language agents use information from this system as inputs and are based on simple recurrent neural networks. This paper describes two sets of experiments exploring the nature of generalization in evolved languages. The first study investigated languages evolved from visual inputs and the second study investigated languages evolved from position representations.

	Abstract = {We present a framework and first set of simulations for evolving a language for communicating about space. The framework comprises two components: (1) An established mobile robot platform, RatSLAM, which has a 'brain' architecture based on rodent hippocampus with the ability to integrate visual and odometric cues to create internal maps of its environment. (2) A language learning system based on a neural network architecture that has been designed and implemented with the ability to evolve generalizable languages which can be learned by naive learners. A study using visual scenes and internal maps streamed from the simulated world of the robots to evolve languages is presented. This study investigated the structure of the evolved languages showing that with these inputs, expressive languages can effectively categorize the world. Ongoing studies are extending these investigations to evolve languages that use the full power of the robots representations in populations of agents.},

Close consideration of cross-disciplinary evidence suggests that speaking is in fact selfish, in that the speaker receives a direct payoff when successful communication takes place.

@article{selten07languageEmergencePNAS,
	Abstract = {We investigate in a series of laboratory experiments how costs and benefits of linguistic communication affect the emergence of simple languages in a coordination task when no common language is available in the beginning. The experiment involved pairwise computerized communication between 152 subjects involved in at least 60 rounds. The subjects had to develop a common code referring to items in varying lists of geometrical figures distinguished by up to three features. A code had to be made of a limited repertoire of letters. Using letters had a cost. We are interested in the question of whether a common code is developed, and what enhances its emergence. Furthermore, we explore the emergence of compositional, protogrammatical structure in such codes. We compare environments that differ in terms of available linguistic resources (number of letters available) and in terms of stability of the task environment (variability in the set of figures). Our experiments show that a too small repertoire of letters causes coordination failures. Cost efficiency and role asymmetry are important factors enhancing communicative success. In stable environments, grammars do not seem to matter much, and instead efficient arbitrary codes often do better. However, in an environment with novelty, compositional grammars offer considerable coordination advantages and therefore are more likely to arise.},

@article{senghas03signLanguage,
	Abstract = {The recent emergence of a new sign language among deaf children and adolescents in Nicaragua provides an opportunity to study how grammatical features of a language arise and spread, and how new language environments are constructed. The grammatical regularities that underlie language use reside largely outside the domain of explicit awareness. Nevertheless, knowledge of these regularities must be transmitted from one generation to the next to survive as part of the language. During this transmission, language form and use is shaped by both the characteristics of ontogenetic development within individual users and by historical changes in patterns of interaction between users. To capture this process, the present study follows the emergence of spatial modulations in Nicaraguan Sign Language (NSL). A comprehension task examining interpretations of spatially modulated verbs reveals that new form-function mappings arise among children who functionally differentiate previously equivalent forms. The new mappings are then acquired by their age peers (who are also children), and by subsequent generations of children who learn the language, but not by adult contemporaries. As a result, language emergence is characterized by a convergence on form within each age cohort, and a mismatch in form from one age cohort to the cohort that follows. In this way, each age cohort, in sequence, transforms the language environment for the next, enabling each new cohort of learners to develop further than its predecessors.},

We found that in their initial creation of the language, children analyzed complex events into basic elements and sequenced these elements into hierarchically structured expressions according to principles not observed in gestures accompanying speech in the surrounding language. Successive cohorts of learners extended this procedure, transforming Nicaraguan signing from its early gestural form into a linguistic system. We propose that this early segmentation and recombination reflect mechanisms with which children learn, and thereby perpetuate, language. Thus, children naturally possess learning abilities capable of giving language its fundamental structure.},

	Abstract = {The lexicon consists of a set of word meanings and their semantic relationships. A systematic representation of the English lexicon based in psycholinguistic considerations has been put together in the database Wordnet in a long-term collaborative effort. We present here a quantitative study of the graph structure of Wordnet to understand the global organization of the lexicon. Semantic links follow power-law, scale-invariant behaviors typical of self-organizing networks. Polysemy (the ambiguity of an individual word) is one of the links in the semantic network, relating the different meanings of a common word. Polysemous links have a profound impact in the organization of the semantic graph, conforming it as a small world network, with clusters of high traffic (hubs) representing abstract concepts such as line, head, or circle. Our results show that: (i) Wordnet has global properties common to many self-organized systems, and (ii) polysemy organizes the semantic graph in a compact and categorical representation, in a way that may explain the ubiquity of polysemy across languages.},

It first approximates this task as a formal mathematical problem. It then presents an implemented algorithm for solving this problem, illustrating its operation on a small example. This algorithm offers one precise interpretation of the intuitive notions of cross-situational learning and the principle of contrast applied between words in an utterance. It robustly learns a homonymous lexicon despite noisy multi-word input, in the presence of referential uncertainty, with no prior knowledge that is specific to the language being learned. Computational simulations demonstrate the robustness of this algorithm and illustrate how algorithms based on cross-situational learning and the principle of contrast might be able to solve lexical-acquisition problems of the size faced by children, under weak, worst-case assumptions about the type and quantity of data available.},

In this paper, I describe the importance of meaning inference, not only in language acquisition, but also in developing a unified explanation for language change and evolution. Using an agent-based computational model of meaning creation and communication, I show how the meanings of words can be inferred through disambiguation across multiple contexts, using cross-situational statistical learning. I demonstrate that the uncertainty inherent in the process of meaning inference, moreover, leads to stable variation in both conceptual and lexical structure, providing evidence which helps to explain how language changes rapidly without losing communicability.

@phdthesis{admsmith03phdthesis,
	Abstract = {In this thesis, I address the problem of how successful communication systems can emerge between agents who do not have innate or explicitly transferable meanings, cannot read the minds of their interlocutors, and are not provided with any feedback about the communication process. I develop a solution by focusing on the role of meanings within the framework of language evolution, and on communication through the repeated inference of meaning. <p> Much recent work on the evolution of language has concentrated on the emergence of compositional syntax as the crucial event which marked the genesis of language; all the experimental models which purport to demonstrate the emergence of syntax, however, rely on models of communication in which the signals are redundant and which contain pre-defined, structured meaning systems which provide an explicit blueprint against which the syntactic structure is built. Moreover, the vast majority of such meaning systems are truly semantic in name only, lacking even the basic semantic characteristics of sense and reference, and the agents must rely on mind-reading or feedback (or both) in order to learn how to communicate. <p> By contrast, at the heart of this thesis is a solution to the signal redundancy paradox based on the inference of meaning and the disambiguation of potential referents through exposure in multiple contexts. I describe computational models of meaning creation in which agents independently develop individual conceptual structures based on their own experiences of the environment, and show through experimental simulations that the agents can use their own individual meanings to communicate with each other about items in their environment. I demonstrate that the development of successful communication depends to a large extent on the synchronisation of the agents' conceptual structures, and that such synchronisation is significantly more likely to occur when the agents use an intelligent meaning creation strategy which can exploit the structure in the information in the environment. <p> Motivated by research into the acquisition of language by children, I go on to explore how the introduction of specific cognitive and lexical biases affects the level of communicative success. I show that if the agents are guided by an assumption of mutual exclusivity in word meanings, they do not need to have such high levels of meaning similarity, and can instead communicate successfully despite having very divergent conceptual structures.},

@article{smith_EvoOfVocabulary,
	Abstract = {Human language is unique among the communication systems of the natural world. The vocabulary of human language is unique in being both culturally-transmitted and symbolic. In this paper I present an investigation into the factors involved in the evolution of such vocabulary systems. I investigate both the cultural evolution of vocabulary systems and the biological evolution of learning rules for vocabulary acquisition. <p> Firstly, vocabularies are shown to evolve on a cultural time-scale so as to fit the expectations of learners --- a population's vocabulary adapts to the biases of the learners in that population. A learning bias in favour of one-to-one mappings between meanings and words leads to the cultural evolution of communicativelyoptimal vocabulary systems, even in the absence of any explicit pressure for communication. Furthermore, the pressure to conform to the biases of learners is shown to outweigh natural selection acting on cultural transmission. Human language learners appear to bring a one-to-one bias to the acquisition of vocabulary systems. The functionality of human vocabulary may therefore be a consequence of the biases of human language learners. <p> Secondly, the evolutionary stability of genetically-transmitted vocabulary learning biases is investigated using both static and dynamic models. A one-to-one learning bias, which leads to the cultural evolution of optimal communication, is shown to be evolutionarily stable. However, the evolution de novo of this bias is complicated by the cumulative nature of the cultural evolution of vocabulary systems. This suggests that the biases of human language learners may not have evolved specifically and exclusively for the acquisition of communicatively-functional vocabulary.},

@phdthesis{smith03phdthesis,
	Abstract = {Theories of language evolution typically attribute its unique structure to pressures acting on the genetic transmission of a language faculty and on the cultural transmission of language itself. In strongly biological accounts, natural selection acting on the genetic transmission of the language faculty is seen as the key determinant of linguistic structure, with culture relegated to a relatively minor role. Strongly cultural accounts place greater emphasis on the role of learning in shaping language, with little or no biological adaptation. <p> Formal modelling of the transmission of language, using mathematical or computational techniques, allows rigorous study of the impact of these two modes of transmission on the structure of language. In this thesis, computational models are used to investigate the evolution of symbolic vocabulary and compositional structure. To what extent can these aspects of language be explained in terms of purely biological or cultural evolution? Should we expect to see a fruitful interaction between these two adaptive processes in a dual transmission model? <p> As a first step towards addressing these questions, models which focus on the cultural transmission of language are developed. These models suggest that the conventionalised symbolic vocabulary and compositional structure of language can emerge through the adaptation of language itself in response to pressure to be learnable. This pressure arises during cultural transmission as a result of 1) the inductive bias of learners and 2) the poverty of the stimulus available to learners. Language-like systems emerge only when learners acquire their linguistic competence on the basis of sparse input and do so using learning procedures which are biased in favour of one-to-one mappings between meanings and signals. Children acquire language under precisely such circumstances. <p> As the second stage of inquiry, dual transmission models are developed to ascertain whether this cultural evolution of language interacts with the biological evolution of the language faculty. In these models an individual's learning bias is assumed to be genetically determined. Surprisingly, natural selection during the genetic transmission of this innate endowment does not reliably result in the development of learning biases which lead, through cultural processes, to language-like communication -- there is no synergistic interaction between biological and cultural evolution. The evolution of language may therefore best be explained in terms of cultural evolution on a domain-general or exapted innate substrate.},

An agent-based model designed to study gene-culture interactions in the evolution of communication is introduced.

@article{smith_theCultural,
	Abstract = {Human language is learned, symbolic and exhibits syntactic structure, a set of properties which make it unique among naturally-occurring communication systems. How did human language come to be as it is? Language is culturally transmitted and cultural processes may have played a role in shaping language. However, it has been suggested that the cultural transmission of language is constrained by some language-specific innate endowment. The primary objective of the research outlined in this paper is to investigate how such an endowment would influence the acquisition of language and the dynamics of the repeated cultural transmission of language. To this end, a new connectionist model of the cultural evolution of communication is presented. In this model an individual's innate endowment is considered to be a learning rule with an associated learning bias. The model allows manipulations to be made to this learning apparatus and the impact of such manipulations on the processes of language acquisition and language evolution to be explored. These investigations reveal that an innate endowment consisting of an ability to read the communicative intentions of others and a bias towards acquiring one-to-one mappings between meanings and signals results in the emergence, through purely cultural processes, of optimal communication. It has previously been suggested that humans possess just such an innate endowment. Properties of human language may therefore best be explained in terms of cultural evolution on an innate substrate.},

We focus here on cultural evolution, and present an Iterated Learning Model of the emergence of compositionality, a fundamental structural property of language. Our main result is to show that the poverty of the stimulus available to language learners leads to a pressure for linguistic structure. When there is a bottleneck on cultural transmission, only a language which is generalizable from sparse input data is stable. Language itself evolves on a cultural time-scale, and compositionality is language's adaptation to stimulus poverty.},

	Abstract = {Models of the cultural evolution of language typically assume a very simplified population dynamic. In the most common modelling framework (the Iterated Learning Model) populations are modelled as consisting of a series of non-overlapping generations, with each generation consisting of a single agent. However, the literature on language birth and language change suggests that population dynamics play an important role in real-world linguistic evolution. We aim to develop computational models to investigate this interaction between population factors and language evolution. Here we present results of extending a well-known Iterated Learning Model to a population model which involves multiple individuals. This extension reveals problems with the model of grammar induction, but also shows that the fundamental results of Iterated Learning experiments still hold when we consider an extended population model.},

Given a corpus of strings (such as text, transcribed speech, chromosome or protein sequence data, sheet music, etc.), our unsupervised algorithm recursively distills from it hierarchically structured patterns. The ADIOS (automatic distillation of structure) algorithm relies on a statistical method for pattern extraction and on structured generalization, two processes that have been implicated in language acquisition. It has been evaluated on artificial context-free grammars with thousands of rules, on natural languages as diverse as English and Chinese, and on protein data correlating sequence with function. This unsupervised algorithm is capable of learning complex syntax, generating grammatical novel sentences, and proving useful in other fields that call for structure discovery from raw data, such as bioinformatics.},

To that end, we introduced island migration (a concept borrowed from population genetics) into the shared lexicon model of communication (Nowak et al., 1999). The effect of fitness linear in language coherence was compared to a control condition of neutral drift. We found that in the neutral condition (no coherence-dependent fitness) even a small migration rate - less than 1% - suffices for one language to become dominant, albeit after a long time. In comparison, when fitness-based selection is introduced, the subpopulations stabilize quite rapidly to form several distinct languages. Our findings support the notion that language confers increased fitness. The possibility that a shared language evolved as a result of neutral drift appears less likely, unless migration rates over evolutionary times were extremely small.},

@incollection{sole_scalingLaw,
	Abstract = {The emergence of complex language is one of the fundamental hallmarks of human evolution. It shaped and constrained the emergence of social structures and makes us different from other animals. Beyond their differences, several remarkable features indicate the presence of fundamental principles of organization shared by all known languages. The best known is the so called Zipf's law, which states that the frequency of a word decays as a (universal) power law of its rank. A different, but related property of human language involves the architecture of word interactions. It has been recently shown that linguistic webs of different types display a global organization that is not very different from the ones observed in other natural and artificial complex networks, from the genome to the internet. In this chapter we explore the statistical features displayed by these seemingly universal laws and their possible origins. It is shown that fundamental principles of organization pervade the origin of power laws in human language and shape its evolutionary history.},

	Abstract = {The similarity of the evolution of human languages (or alphabets, bird songs, ...) to biological evolution of species is utilized to study with up to $10^9$ people the rise and fall of languages either by macroscopic differential equations similar to biological Lotka-Volterra equation, or by microscopic Monte Carlo simulations of bit-strings incorporating the birth, maturity, and death of every individual. For our bit-string model, depending on parameters either one language comprises the majority of speakers (dominance), or the population splits into many languages having in order of magnitude the same number of speakers (fragmentation); in the latter case the size distribution is log-normal, with upward deviations for small sizes, just as in reality for human languages. On a lattice two different dominating languages can coexist in neighbouring regions, without being favoured or disfavoured by different status. We deal with modifications and competition for existing languages, not with the evolution or learning of one language.},

@incollection{steels07symbolGrounding,
	Abstract = {In the nineteen eighties, a lot of ink was spent on the question of symbol grounding, largely triggered by Searle{\^a}{\texttrademark}s Chinese Room story. Searle{\^a}{\texttrademark}s article had the advantage of stirring up discussion about when and how symbols could be about things in the world, whether intelligence involves representations or not, what embodiment means and under what conditions cognition is embodied, etc. But almost twenty years of philosophical discussion have shed little light on the issue, partly because the discussion has been mixed up with arguments whether artificial intelligence was possible or not. Today I believe that sufficient progress has been made in cognitive science and AI that we can move forward and study the processes involved in representations instead of worrying about the general framework with which this should be done.},

@article{steels06semioticDynamics,
	Abstract = {Semiotic dynamics involves the processes whereby groups of people or artificial agents collectively invent and negotiate shared semiotic systems, which they use for communication or information organization. Tagging systems (such as Flickr, CiteULike, del.icio.us, or connotea) offer examples of human semiotic dynamics at work, aided by technologies such as the Internet but also by a new sense of collective action in an increasingly connected world. Semiotic dynamics builds on many earlier AI developments: the insights into and technologies of semantic networks and knowledge representation from the seventies, the ideas on embodiment and grounding from the late eighties, and the perspective of multiagent systems from the nineties. But all these aspects join together into a new vision on intelligence, with the social, collective dynamics of representation-making at the center. These new AI developments don't stand in isolation; they resonate with recent developments in linguistics, psychology, and the mathematical study of networks. This article briefly illustrates the current study of semiotic dynamics, the resulting technologies, and the field's impact on current and future intelligent systems applications. This article is part of a special issue on the Future of AI.},

Artificial Intelligence can make a major contribution to this problem by working out precise, testable models using grounded robotic agents which interact with a real world environment and communicate among themselves or with humans about this environment. A potential side effect op this basic research are new technologies for man-machine interaction based on the negotiation of shared conventions.},

The models are inspired by the main approaches to human categorisation being discussed in the literature: nativism, empiricism, and culturalism. Colour is taken as a case study. Although we take no stance on which position is to be accepted as final truth with respect to human categorisation and naming, we do point to theoretical constraints that make each position more or less likely and we make clear suggestions on what the best engineering solution would be. Specifically, we argue that the collective choice of a shared repertoire must integrate multiple constraints, including constraints coming from communication.},

This paper reports how we deal with this problem within the context of Fluid Construction Grammars ({\sc fcg}). {\sc Fcg} is a general unification-based inference engine which has been designed to support experiments in the self-organisation of language in a population of interacting situated embodied agents.

We advocate the use of mecha- nisms inspired from natural language, that enable each agent to develop a repertoire of grounded categories and labels for these categories and negotiate their use with other agents. The communication system as well as its semantics is hence emergent and adaptive instead of predefined. It is the result of a self-organised semiotic dynamics where relations be- tween data, labels for the data, and the categories associated with the labels undergo constant evolution.},

Our hypothesis is that when agents engage in particular interactive behaviors which in turn require specific cognitive structures, they automatically arrive at a language system. We study this topic by performing experiments based on artificial systems.

@unpublished{steels06markPerspective,
	Abstract = {The fascinating question of the origins of human language is often approached by studying specific universal trends in language, such as the use of recursion (1), or the expression of predicate-argument structure (2). This article conducts such a case study for perspective reversal (as in English: your left versus my left) (3). It argues that this universal can be explained by hypothesising that individuals recruit cognitive subsystems into their language faculty (4) if doing so helps them to achieve greater communicative success with less cognitive effort. We present a model in the form of embodied robotic agents that play language games about events in their environments (5). The agents have basic capabilities to not only invent and negotiate perceptually grounded concepts and lexicons, but also to perform egocentric perspective transformation (6) and use it for language. In a breakthrough experiment we show how the model predicts that perspective marking is a better strategy for embodied gents in self-organized communication systems and hence why it has become a universal feature of human languages.},

Naming games are interactions between two agents, a speaker and a hearer, in which the speaker identifies an object using a name. Adaptive naming games imply that speaker and hearer update their lexicons to become better in future games. By engaging in adaptive naming games, a coherent shared vocabulary arises through self-organisation in a population of distributed agents. When the agents are spatially distributed, diversity can be shown to arise, and changes, in population contact lead to language changes.},

@inproceedings{steels06grammarParsing,
	Abstract = {According to the functional approach to language evolution (inspired by cognitive linguistics and construction grammar), grammar arises to deal with issues in communication among autonomous agents, particularly maximisation of communicative success and expressive power and minimisation of cognitive effort. Experiments in the emergence of grammar should hence start from a simulation of communicative exchanges between embodied agents, and then show how a particular issue that arises can be solved or partially solved by introducing more grammar. This paper shows a case study of this approach, focusing on the issue of search during parsing. Multiple hypotheses arise in parsing when the same syntactic pattern can be used for multiple purposes or when one syntactic pattern partly overlaps with another one. It is well known that syntactic ambiguity rapidly leads to combinatorial explosions and hence an increase in memory use and processing power, possibly to a point where the sentence can no longer be handled. Additional grammar, such as syntactic or semantic subcategorisation or word order and agreement constraints can help to dampen search because it provides information to the hearer which hypotheses are the most likely. The paper shows an operational experiment where avoiding search is used as the driver for the introduction and negotiation of syntax. The experiment is also a demonstration of how Fluid Construction Grammar is well suited for experiments in language evolution.},

@inproceedings{steels07ECAL,
	Abstract = {Language can be viewed as a complex adaptive system which is continuously shaped and reshaped by the actions of its users as they try to solve communicative problems. To maintain coherence in the overall system, different language elements (sounds, words, grammatical constructions) compete with each other for global acceptance. This paper examines what happens when a language system uses systematic structure, in the sense that certain meaning-form conventions are themselves parts of larger units. We argue that in this case multi-level selection occurs: at the level of elements (e.g. tense affixes) and at the level of larger units in which these elements are used (e.g. phrases). Achieving and maintaining linguistic coherence in the population under these conditions is non-trivial. This paper shows that it is nevertheless possible when agents take multiple levels into account both for processing meaning-form associations and for consolidating the language inventory after each interaction.},

@inproceedings{sternberg06implicationOfBilingualism,
	Abstract = {Simultaneous acquisition of multiple languages to a native level of fluency is common in many areas of the world. This ability must be represented in any cognitive mechanisms used for language. Potential explanations of the evolution of language must also account for the bilingual case. Surprisingly, this fact has not been widely considered in the literature on language origins and evolution. We consider any array of potential accounts for this phenomenon, including arguments by selectionists on the basis for language variation. We find scant evidence for specific selection of the multilingual ability prior to language origins. Thus it seems more parsimonious that bilingualism ``came for free'' along with whatever mechanisms did evolve. Sequential learning mechanisms may be able to accomplish multilingual acquisition without specific adaptations. In support of this perspective, we present a simple recurrent network model that is capable of learning two idealized grammars simultaneously. These results are compared with recent studies of bilingual processing using eyetracking and fMRI showing vast overlap in the areas in the brain used in processing two different languages.},

	Abstract = {Human language has enabled our species to exchange information and to formulate ideas; understanding how human linguistic faculties evolved is one of the great challenges in evolutionary theory. Studies of the evolution of human language can be broadly separated into two types of approaches: those that consider the (e.g. phylogenetic) relationships between existing languages and their common ancestors; and those that try to understand the evolution of the human language capacity itself. For the latter case, Martin Nowak and co-workers have now shown that evolutionary game theory provides a framework in which the evolution of linguistic elements, such as word formation and syntax, can be investigated. These recent studies show that natural selection will favour the evolution of such `human' linguistic elements from simple animal communication if they enable more reliable exchange of relevant, that is fitness-enhancing, information.},

@article{sutherland04extinctionNATURE,
	Abstract = {There are global threats to biodiversity with current extinction rates well above background levels1. Although less well publicized, numerous human languages have also become extinct, and others are threatened with extinction. However, estimates of the number of threatened languages vary considerably owing to the wide range of criteria used. For example, languages have been classified as threatened if the number of speakers is less than 100, 500, 1,000, 10,000, 20,000 or 100,000 (ref. 3). Here I show, by applying internationally agreed criteria for classifying species extinction risk4, that languages are more threatened than birds or mammals. Rare languages are more likely to show evidence of decline than commoner ones. Areas with high language diversity also have high bird and mammal diversity and all three show similar relationships to area, latitude, area of forest and, for languages and birds, maximum altitude. The time of human settlement has little effect on current language diversity. Although similar factors explain the diversity of languages and biodiversity, the factors explaining extinction risk for birds and mammals (high altitude, high human densities and insularity) do not explain the numbers of endangered languages.},

We suggest that including the study of the emergence of artificial languages, in simulation settings, allows us to ask a more general question, namely, what are the minimal initial conditions for the emergence of language? This is a very important question from a technological viewpoint, because it is very closely tied to questions of intelligence and autonomy. We identify anticipation as being a key underlying computational principle in the emergence of language. We suggest that this is in fact present implicitly in many of the theories in contention today. Focused simulations that address precise questions are necessary to isolate the roles of the minimal initial conditions for the emergence of language.},

In particular, we utilize the replicator-mutator framework of language evolution for the creation of an emergent agent interaction topology that leads to quick convergence. In our system, it is the links between agents that are treated as the units of selection and replication, rather than the languages themselves. We use the Noisy Preferential Attachment algorithm, which is a special case of the replicator-mutator process, for generating the topology. The advantage of the NPA algorithm is that, in the short-term, it produces a scale-free interaction network, which is helpful for rapid exploration of the space of languages present in the population. A change of parameter settings then ensures convergence because it guarantees the emergence of a single dominant node which is chosen as teacher almost always},

	Abstract = {We suggest that the primary motivation for an agent to construct a symbol-meaning mapping is to solve a task. The meaning space of an agent should be derived from the tasks that it faces during the course of its lifetime. We outline a process in which agents learn to solve multiple tasks and extract a store of ``cumulative knowledge'' that helps them to solve each new task more quickly and accurately. This cumulative knowledge then forms the ontology or meaning space of the agent. We suggest that by grounding symbols to this extracted cumulative knowledge agents can gain a further performance benefit because they can guide each others' learning process. In this version of the symbol grounding problem meanings cannot be directly communicated because they are internal to the agents, and they will be different for each agent. Also, the meanings may not correspond directly to objects in the environment. The communication process can also allow a symbol meaning mapping that is dynamic. We posit that these properties make this version of the symbol grounding problem realistic and natural. Finally, we discuss how symbols could be grounded to cumulative knowledge via a situation where a teacher selects tasks for a student to perform.},

However, their overabundance makes many researchers sceptical of such theorising. Here, we suggest that a more rigorous approach is needed towards their construction although, despite justified scepticism, there is no agreement as to the criteria that should be used to determine the validity of the various competing theories. We attempt to fill this gap by providing criteria upon which the various historical narratives can be judged. Although individually none of these criteria are highly constraining, taken together they could provide a useful evolutionary framework for thinking about the evolution of human language.},

This paper describes automatic acquisition of dialog strategies through interaction between two agents. In the experiments, two agents infer each other's comprehension level from its facial expressions and utterances to acquire efficient strategies. Q-learning is applied to a strategy acquisition mechanism. Firstly, experiments are carried out through the interaction between a mother agent, who knows all the word meanings, and a child agent with no initial word meaning. The experimental results showed that the mother agent acquires a teaching strategy, while the child agent acquires an asking strategy. Next, the experiments of interaction between a human and an agent are investigated to evaluate the acquired strategies. The results showed the effectiveness of both strategies of teaching and asking.},

An IA acquires word meanings through learning the relations among visual features of objects and acoustic features of human speech. In this task, the IA has to find out which visual features are indicated by the speech. Previous works introduced stochastic approaches to do this, however, such approaches need many examples to achieve high accuracy. In this paper, firstly, we propose a word meaning acquisition method for the IA based on an Online-EM algorithm without learning biases. Then, we implement two types of biases into it to accelerate the word meaning acquisition. Experimental results show that the proposed method with biases can efficiently acquire word meanings.},

@article{tallerman07holisticProtolanguageLINGUA,
	Abstract = {The dominant theory of the evolution of complex language from protolanguage can be termed the synthetic approach. Under this view, single words arose first in evolution, and were combined as syntax evolved. More recently, an alternative scenario for protolanguage has been proposed, which we can term the holistic approach. Scholars subscribing to this view propose that words emerge from longer, entirely arbitrary strings of sounds - non-compositional utterances - via a process of fractionation. Such holistic utterances initially have no internal structure, but represent whole messages. The idea is that over time, chance phonetic similarities are observed between sections of utterances, and that if similar meanings can be ascribed to these strings, then 'words' will emerge. This paper dissects the main ideas found in the holistic approach, and argues on a number of grounds that it is conceptually and empirically flawed. A proposal that protolanguage developed out of an earlier holistic primate communication system is hard to sustain, in view of differences between primate vocalization and language. Evidence against the holistic approach is offered on the basis of known facts about the historical development of natural languages, and a conclusion is drawn in favour of synthetic models of protolanguage.},

The novelty of the present framework resides in the separation between form (phonology and syntax) and meaning (semantics), which are described as two different selection systems, connected by symbolic association and by probabilistic encoding of information.},

In this thesis I propose that this structure can be explained in terms of the pressures acting on it: every aspect of the organisation of the lexicon is an adaptation ultimately related to the function of language as a tool for human communication, or to the fact that language has to be learned by subsequent generations of people. A collection of methods, most of which are applied to a Spanish speech corpus, reveal structure at different levels of the lexicon. ...},

@article{tang07languageGame,
	Abstract = {We present a modified naming game by introducing weights of words in the evolution process. We assign the weight of a word spoken by an agent according to its connectivity, which is a natural reflection of the agent's influence in population. A tunable parameter is introduced, governing the word weight based on the connectivity of agents. We consider the scale-free topology and concentrate on the efficiency of reaching the final consensus, which is of high importance in the self-organized system. Interestingly, it is found that there exists an optimal parameter value, leading to the fastest convergence. This indicates appropriate hub's effects favor the achievement of consensus. The evolution of distinct words helps to give a qualitative explanation of this phenomena. Similar nontrivial phenomena are observed in the total memory of agents with a peak in the middle range of parameter values. Other relevant characters are provided as well, including the time evolution of total memory and success rate for different parameter values as well as the average degree of the network, which are helpful for understanding the dynamics of the modified naming game in detail.},

Information about the environ- ment is not simply recorded as a look-up table, but is rather compressed in a theory or schema. Several conjectures are proposed: (I) compression aids in generalization; (II) compression occurs more easily in a ``smooth'', as opposed to a ``rugged'', string space; and (III) constraints from com- pression make it likely that natural languages evolve towards smooth string spaces. We have been examining the role of such compression for learning and evolution of formal languages by artificial agents. Our sys- tem does seem to conform generally to these expectations, but the trade- o{\'o}between compression and the errors that sometimes accompany it need careful consideration.},

	Abstract = {For many adaptive complex systems information about the environment is not simply recorded in a look-up table, but is rather encoded in a theory, schema, or model, which compresses the information. The grammar of a language can be viewed as such a schema or theory. In a prior study [Teal et al., 1999] we proposed several conjectures about the learning and evolution of language that should follow from these observations: (C1) compression aids in generalization; (C2) compression occurs more easily in a smooth, as opposed to a rugged, problem space; and (C3) constraints from compression make it likely that natural languages eveolve toward smooth string spaces. This previous work found general, if not complete support for these three conjectures. Here we build on that study to clarify the relationship between Minimum Description Length (MDL) and error in our model and examine evolution of certain languages in more detail. Our results suggest a fourth conjecture: that all else being equal, (C4) more complex languages change more rapidly during evolution.},

@article{tesileanu06HammingDistance,

The individuals can change their mother tongue during their lifespan, pass on their language to their offspring and finally die. The languages are described by bitstrings, their mutual difference is expressed in terms of their Hamming distance. Language evolution is determined by mutation and adaptation rates. In particular we consider the case where the replacement of a language by another one is determined by their mutual Hamming distance. As a function of the mutation rate we find a sharp transition between a scenario with one dominant language and fragmentation into many language clusters. The transition is also reflected in the Hamming distance between the two languages with the largest and second to largest number of speakers. We also consider the case where the population is localized on a square lattice and the interaction of individuals is restricted to a certain geometrical domain. Here it is again the Hamming distance that plays an essential role in the final fate of a language of either surviving or being extinct.},

@phdthesis{tonkes01onThe,
	Abstract = {This thesis explores a perspective for explaining the origins of linguistic structure that is based on considerations beyond the constraints of the language acquisition device. In contrast to the theory of Universal Grammar proposed by Chomsky, this perspective considers how the processes of language acquisition and use create a dynamical system that is capable of adapting linguistic structure to the inductive biases of learners. In this view it is possible to conceive of language adapting to aid its own survival: those languages that are more reliably and easily acquired will tend to persist for longer than their less easily learned counterparts. Thus, linguistic structures are seen as emergent, adaptive phenomena rather than preordained features of language. <p> The particular issue that this thesis investigates is the extent to which language adaptation can facilitate acquisition by general-purpose learners. In the Generative Grammar tradition much is made of the necessity for domain-specific constraints on the language acquisition device. (Indeed, that there must be a distinct mental com- ponent dedicated to language tasks.) This outlook is in contrast to the connectionist viewpoint, which posits far more moderately constrained, domain-general mecha- nisms. This thesis examines how language adaptation can give general-purpose, connectionist learners the appearance of being language-savvy learners. <p> A simulation framework is proposed in which agents attempt to communicate simple concepts to one another using sequential utterances. In earlier simulations we aim to maximise the learnability of a language for the communication task. Later simulations show how the processes of language production and acquisition, when iterated, are capable of producing such languages. In total, three series of simulations are performed. <p> The first series of simulations addresses the question of how linguistic structure adapts when sender and receiver disagree on the form of language that is easiest to learn. Analysis reveals that, if necessary, the structural properties of language can take on forms that compromise between the competing constraints on sender and receiver. <p> The second series of simulations considers the bottleneck of linguistic transmis- sion: the requirement that learners generalise from a limited set of observed utter- ances to the entire language. Results show that generalisability can be boosted in a naive, domain-general learner by allowing language to adapt to the inductive biases present in the learner. <p> The third and final series of simulations investigates how the dynamical charac- teristics of linguistic change depend on the properties that drive the dynamics. That is, we explore the range of conditions under which the iterated learning dynamic is su{\AE}cient to establish a learnable language throughout the population. The results of these simulations show that the iterated learning dynamic is indeed able to act as a generator of languages that general-purpose learners are capable of acquiring. <p> The results from these studies suggest that through the dynamics of linguistic transmission, language can adapt to the capabilities and biases of its users. Fur- thermore, that language can exploit the inductive biases of general-purpose learning mechanisms to facilitate their own acquisition, contrary to Universal Grammar's hypothesised need for an innate, domain-specific acquisition mechanism.},

	Abstract = {Traditional theories of child language acquisition center around the existence of a language acquisition device which is specifically tuned for learning a particular class of languages. More recent proposals suggest that language acquisition is assisted by the evolution of languages towards forms that are easily learnable. In this paper, we evolve combinatorial languages which can be learned by a simple recurrent network quickly and from relatively few examples. Additionally, we evolve languages for generalization in different ``worlds'', and for generalization from specific examples. We find that languages can be evolved to facilitate different forms of impressive generalization for a minimally biased learner. The results provide empirical support for the theory that the language itself, as well as the language environment of a learner, plays a substantial role in learning: that there is far more to language acquisition than the language acquisition device.},

	Abstract = {We develop a new framework for studying the biases that recurrent neural networks bring to language processing tasks. A semantic concept represented by a point in Euclidian space is translated into a symbol sequence by an encoder network. This sequence is then fed to a decoder network which attempts to translate it back to the original concept. We show how a pair of recurrent networks acting as encoder and decoder can develop their own symbolic language that is serially transmitted between them either forwards or backwards. The encoder and decoder bring different constraints to the task, and these early results indicate that the conflicting nature of these constraints may be reflected in the language that ultimately emerges, providing important clues to the structure of human languages.},

	Abstract = {We study an evolutionary language game that describes how signals become associated with meaning. In our context, a language, L, is described by two matrices: the P matrix contains the probabilities that for a speaker certain objects are associated with certain signals, while the Q matrix contains the probabilities that for a listener certain signals are associated with certain objects. We define the payoff in our evolutionary language game as the total amount of information exchanged between two individuals. We give a formal classification of all languages, L(P, Q), describing the conditions for Nash equilibria and evolutionarily stable strategies (ESS). We describe an algorithm for generating all languages that are Nash equilibria. Finally, we show that starting from any random language, there exists an evolutionary trajectory using selection and neutral drift that ends up with a strategy that is a strict Nash equilibrium (or very close to a strict Nash equilibrium).},

@inproceedings{trianni04ANTS_swarm,
	Abstract = {Communication is often required for coordination of collective behaviours. Social insects like ants, termites or bees make use of different forms of communication, which can be roughly classified in three classes: indirect (stigmergic) communication, direct interaction and direct communication. The use of stigmergic communication is predominant in social insects (e.g., the pheromone trails in ants), but also direct interactions (e.g., antennation in ants) and direct communication can be observed (e.g., the waggle dance of honey bee workers). Direct communication may be beneficial when a fast reaction is expected, as for instance, when a danger is detected and countermeasures must be taken. This is the case of hole avoidance, the task studied in this paper: a group of selfassembled robots - called swarm-bot - coordinately explores an arena containing holes, avoiding to fall into them. In particular, we study the use of direct communication in order to achieve a reaction to the detection of a hole faster than with the sole use of direct interactions through physical links. We rely on artificial evolution for the synthesis of neural network controllers, showing that evolving behaviours that make use of direct communication is more effective than exploiting direct interactions only.},

We develop a ''statistical signature'' of a language, analogous to the genetic signature proposed by Karlin in biology, and we show its stability within languages and its discriminative power between languages. Using this representation, we address the question of its trajectory during language evolution. We first reconstruct a phylogenetic tree of IE languages using this property, in this way showing that it also contains enough information to act as a ''tracking'' tag for a language during its evolution. One advantage of this kind of phylogenetic trees is that they do not depend on any semantic assessment or on any choice of words. We use the ''statistical signature'' to analyze a time-series of documents from four romance languages, following their transition from latin. The languages are italian, french, spanish and portuguese, and the time points correspond to all centuries from III bC to XX AD.},

@article{ujhelyi96jtb,
	Abstract = {Animal communication and human language have fundamental differences in their structures and functions. Furthermore, there is no living species demonstrating an intermediate stage of language evolution. Thus, we have difficulty in finding characteristics attributable to a communication system which can already be considered as a starting point for linguistic evolution. However, some findings coming from neurolinguistic research give us the opportunity to suppose that varying and arranging linguistic elements can be detached from other grammatical functions. Further information in this direction comes from apes' language-teaching experiments; namely bonobos (Panpaniscus) are able to understand and produce differences in meaning by varying word arrangements. Based on these results one can suppose that an acoustic signal system, which possesses discrete units for variable use, might be very ancient and might exist independent and prior to a more advanced language state. In the natural setting, acoustic territorial marking behaviour is exposed to selection pressure to elaborate sign systems built up from discrete, variable units. In addition to the well-known territorial bird songs, some monkey species and all species of lesser apes have territorial songs fitting these criteria. The analyses of the so-called long calls in chimpanzees and bonobos make it likely that the group-living great apes preserved the ability to create syntactically different calls, which would be developed by requirements of social life. A call repertoire emerged in these species, which contained a large number of call variants at group level available for each group member via social learning. This type of animal call is different from ordinary animal communication; its how some features of human language. It can represent an intermediate stage between animal communication and language, and communication system similar to this one can be considered as a starting point or first stage of language evolution.},

	Abstract = {The origins of language have become a hotly debated topic in the last decade. Researchers from many fields have been trying to explain them using the tools that their specialisations provide. Also in Artificial Intelligence their has been interest in the topic, and computer science provides a very powerful tool for studying language as a complex dynamical system: multi-agent systems. In the thesis, we present four models based on the ``Language Game'' paradigm developed by Luc Steels for studying language. We support a gradualist view of the evolution of language, and we provide partial answers to three issues that need to be clarified in order to strengthen this position: (1) each stadium of the developing communication system must be viable and successful in its own right; (2) their must be a path from each intermediate communication system to the next; and (3) the users of the communication systems must be able to transition from one system to the next using only local data. Three models describe intermediate communication systems: a system in which the agents can exchange single words referencing one referent; a system in which the agents can exchange several words referencing one referent; and a system in which the agents can exchange complex, structured utterances referencing several referents. Experiments with these systems show that each system is a successful communication system in its own right. The fourth model attempts to show that the agents can make the transition from one communication system to the next successfully and on their own. Agents in this system have the cognitive capacities for two systems: (1) and (2), and have internal pressures that can push either of the communication systems as the one to use, based on different criteria. Two criteria push the agents from system (1) to system (2), yielding interesting results. The models and experiments in the thesis give positive results for each of the issues to be clarified, thereby supporting the gradual evolution hypothesis.},

This paper introduces a model that makes it possible to study the interaction between these two parts of language. The model comprises a population of agents that feature a relatively complex semantic module, and a lexicalisation module that can produce utterances from semantic representations. The language the agents use to communicate is developed through their interactions, without central control.

This approach aims to develop a neural model of human language capacity that incorporates important constraints on language structure, language comprehension and performance, and brain structure. The model is then to be used as a target for development or evolution. To this end, the target model would have to be simplified, so that the target model can be derived from the simplified version and learning algorithms (or structural changes). The benefit of this approach is that the development of important constraints such as the combinatorial productivity of human language is ensured. The paper illustrates the importance of including this constraint in models of language development and evolution. It then describes a neural model in which this constraint is satisfied. Finally, the paper describes how such a model could be used to investigate language development and/or evolution.},

	Abstract = {This chapter discusses how Darwin's evolution theory can be applied to explain language evolution at a cultural level. So, rather than viewing language evolution as a process in which the users adapt biologically to learn language, languages themselves adapt to the learning abilities of individuals. Within this framework, languages evolve through variation, competition and selection. Invention and learning are identified as variation mechanisms; learnability, transmission bottlenecks and stability are pressures for competition; and optimising for success is a good selection mechanism. Rather than studying the language development in individual users, this chapter illustrates how artificial multi-agent systems equipped with these principles can self-organise a compositional language from scratch. It is argued that this model offers a good alternative to many standard approaches in linguistics.},

The simulations are based on a model that integrates the language game model with the iterated learning model. The simulations show that compositional structures tend to emerge more extensively for larger groups, which has a positive effect on the time in which the languages develop and on communicative success, which may even have an optimal group size. A mathematical analysis of the time of convergence is presented that provides an approximate explanation of the results. The paper concludes that increasing group sizes among humans could not only have triggered the origins of language, but also facilitated the evolution of more complex languages.},

The simulations are based on multi-agent systems that play language games in order to communicate, invent and learn language. The language games are integrated with the iterated learning model that simulates a population turnover, where the population contains adults and children. Experiments show that when the population size is increased, after an initial decrease in performance, the results show an important improvement when the population size is increased further. These results are explained by a hypothesised trade off between increasing difficulties in achieving a conventionalised system and an increased likelihood of finding structures that emerge by chance when the population size increases.},

@article{vogt05sparseInputABJ,
	Abstract = {This paper investigates the productive creativity of children in a computational model on the emergence and evolution of compositional structures in language. In previous models it was shown that compositional structures can emerge in language when the language is transmitted from one generation to the next through a transmission bottleneck. Due to the fact that in these models language is transmitted only in a vertical direction where adults only speak to children and children only listen, this bottleneck needs to be imposed by the experimenter. In the current study, this bottleneck is removed and instead of having a vertical transmission of language, the language is -- in most simulations -- transmitted horizontally (i.e. any agent can speak to any other agent). It is shown that such a horizontal transmission scenario does not need an externally imposed bottleneck, because the children face an implicit bottleneck when they start speaking early in life. The model is compared with the recent development of Nicaraguan Sign Language, where it is observed that children are a driving force for inventing grammatical (or compositional) structures, possibly due to a sparseness of input (i.e. an implicit bottleneck). The results show that in the studied model children are indeed the creative driving force for the emergence and stable evolution of compositional languages, thus suggesting that this implicit bottleneck may -- in part -- explain why children are so typically good at acquiring language and, moreover, why they may have been the driving force for the emergence of grammar in language.},

@article{vogt05compositionalGrounded_AIJ,

The model is based on recent work in language evolution modelling, including the iterated learning model, the language game model and the Talking Heads experiment. It further adopts techniques recently developed in the field of grammar induction. The paper reports on a number of different experiments done with this new model and shows certain conditions under which compositional structures can emerge. The paper confirms previous findings that a transmission bottleneck serves as a pressure mechanism for the emergence of compositionality, and that a communication strategy for guessing the references of utterances aids in the development of qualitatively `good' languages. In addition, the results show that the emerging languages reflect the structure of the world to a large extent and that the development of a semantics, together with a competitive selection mechanism, produces a faster emergence of compositionality than a predefined semantics without such a selection mechanism.},

This allows an optimization between the form (i.e. the `traditional' symbol) and the referent. A robotic experiment based on adaptive language games illustrates how the anchoring of semiotic symbols can be achieved in a bottom-up fashion.

It will be argued that symbolic structures can be used within the paradigm of embodied cognitive science by adopting an alternative definition of a symbol. In this alternative definition, the symbol may be viewed as a structural coupling between an agent's sensorimotor activations and its environment. A robotic experiment is presented in which mobile robots develop a symbolic structure from scratch by engaging in a series of language games. In this experiment it is shown that robots can develop a symbolic structure with which they can communicate the names of a few objects with a remarkable degree of success. It is further shown that, although the referents may be interpreted differently on different occasions, the objects are usually named with only one form.},

	Abstract = {This paper presents a series of experiments in which two mobile robots develop a shared lexicon of which the meaning is grounded in the real world. The experiments investigate the impact of non-verbal communication on lexicon formation. Non-verbal communication is used to establish joint attention or to evaluate feedback. The experiments implement adaptive language games in which two agents try to communicate some real world object. When the agents fail, they can adapt their memory in order to improve performance on future occasions. As the experimental results show, the quality of the evolved lexicon is better when feedback is used rather than joint attention.},

A preliminary experiment is presented in which we investigate the effect of a number of learning mechanisms.

@article{vylder06namingGameConvergenceJTB,
	Abstract = {In this paper we introduce a mathematical model of naming games. Naming games have been widely used within research on the origins and evolution of language. Despite the many interesting empirical results these studies have produced, most of this research lacks a formal elucidating theory. In this paper we show how a population of agents can reach linguistic consensus, i.e. learn to use one common language to communicate with one another. Our approach differs from existing formal work in two important ways: one, we relax the too strong assumption that an agent samples infinitely often during each time interval. This assumption is usually made to guarantee convergence of an empirical learning process to a deterministic dynamical system. Two, we provide a proof that under these new realistic conditions, our model converges to a common language for the entire population of agents. Finally the model is experimentally validated.},

@article{wagner02complexity,
	Abstract = {How does a group of individuals who lack a shared communication system evolve to achieve a consensus, so that every member of the group uses each signal in a manner consistent with others in the group? There are many factors that affect the difficulty of this task, including the number of signals available, the number of meanings or situations to convey, the population size, and whether or not any learning occurs. Each of these factors is explored in simulations which use a genetic algorithm that selects for agents who communicate meanings effectively with other agents. The difficulty of gaining consensus among a population of signalers increases as the number of meanings (and signals) increases, but decreases if more signals than meanings are allowed. Surprisingly, difficulty decreases as population size increases. An analysis is made of the exponentially increasing difficulty of achieving consensus as the number of meanings and signals grows. The implications for the evolution of communication are discussed.},

@article{wagner06emergenceCommunication,
	Abstract = {Previous simulation work on the evolution of communication has not shown how a large signal repertoire could emerge in situated agents. We present an artificial life simulation of agents, situated in a two-dimensional world, that must search for other agents with whom they can trade resources. With strong restrictions on which resources can be traded for others, initially non-communicating agents evolve/learn a signal system that describes the resource they seek and the resource they are willing to offer in return. A large signal repertoire emerges mainly through an evolutionary process. Agents whose production and comprehension abilities rely on a single mechanism fare best, although learning enables agents with separate mechanisms to achieve some measure of success. These results demonstrate that substantial signaling repertoires can evolve in situated multi-agent systems, and suggest that simulated social interactions such as trading may provide a useful context for further computational studies of the evolution of communication.},

@article{wang04basicWords,
	Abstract = {In this paper, the basic words introduced by Swadesh(1952,1955) are used to uncover information about language evolution. In section 2, based on Chen (1996), Swadesh's 200-word list can be split into two sub-groups; the first 100 words, called high rank, are more stable and loan-resistant than the second 100, called low rank. More retentions tend to be present among the high rank words while borrowed elements tend to occur more frequently among the low rank words. This feature can be used to distinguish retentions and borrowings when the evolution of a language has been blurred by language contact, such as the transmission of Middle Chinese entering tones into Pekinese. In section 3, we argue that Swadesh (1955)'s 100 basic words (high rank) are better for sub-grouping Chinese dialects, compared with Dolgopolsky (1964)'s 15-word list and Yakhontov' 35-word list.},

@inproceedings{wang02aamas,
	Abstract = {To create multi-agent systems that are both adaptive and open, agents must collectively learn to generate their own concepts, interpretations, and even languages actively in an online fashion. The issue is that there is no pre- existing global concept to be learned; instead, agents are in effect collectively designing a concept that is evolving as they exchange information. This paper presents a framework of {\it mutual online concept learning} (MOCL) in a shared world. MOCL extends the classical online concept learning from single-agent to multi-agent setting. Based on the Perceptron algorithm, we design a specific MOCL algorithm, called the {\it mutual perceptron convergence algorithm}, which can converge within a finite number of mistakes under some conditions. Analysis of the convergence conditions shows that the possibility of convergence depends on the number of participating agents and the quality of the instances they produce. Finally, we point out applications of MOCL and the convergence algorithm to the formation of linguistic knowledge in the form of dynamically generated shared vocabulary and grammar structure for multiple agents.},

@article{wang05verticalAndHorizontalTransmission,
	Abstract = {It has been observed that borrowing within a group of genetically related languages often causes the lexical similarities among them to be skewed. Consequently, it has been proposed that borrowing can sometimes be inferred from such skewing. However, heterogeneity in the rate of lexical replacement, as well as borrowing from other languages, can also give rise to skewed lexical similarities. It is important, therefore, to determine to what degree skewing is a statistically significant indicator of borrowing. Here, we describe a statistical hypothesis test for detecting language contact based on skewing of linguistic characters of arbitrary type. Significant probabilities of correct detection of contact are maintained for various contact scenarios, with low false alarm probability. Our experiments show that the test is fairly robust to substantial heterogeneity in the retention rate, both across characters and across lineages, suggesting that the method can provide an objective criterion against which claims of significant skewing due to contact can be tested, pointing the way for more detailed analysis.},

@article{wang05invasionOfLanguage,
	Abstract = {Research into the emergence and evolution of human language has received unprecedented attention during the past 15 years. Efforts to better understand the processes of language emergence and evolution have proceeded in two main directions: from the top-down (linguists) and from the bottom-up (cognitive scientists). Language can be viewed as an invading process that has had profound impact on the human phenotype at all levels, from the structure of the brain to modes of cultural interaction. In our view, the most effective way to form a connection between the two efforts (essential if theories for language evolution are to reflect the constraints imposed on language by the brain) lies in computational modelling, an approach that enables numerous hypotheses to be explored and tested against objective criteria and which suggest productive paths for empirical researchers to then follow. Here, with the aim of promoting the cross-fertilization of ideas across disciplines, we review some of the recent research that has made use of computational methods in three principal areas of research into language evolution: language emergence, language change, and language death.},

@article{wedel07feedbackLexicon,
	Abstract = {Phonologies are characterised by regularity, from the stereotyped phonetic characteristics of allophones to the contextually conditioned alternations between them. Most models of grammar account for regularity by hypothesising that there is only a limited set of symbols for expressing underlying forms, and that an independent grammar algorithm transforms symbol sequences into an output representation. However, this explanation for regularity is called into question by research which suggests that the mental lexicon records rich phonetic detail that directly informs production. Given evidence for biases favouring previously experienced forms at many levels of production and perception, I argue that positive feedback within a richly detailed lexicon can produce regularity over many cycles of production and perception. Using simulation as a tool, I show that under the influence of positive feedback, gradient biases in usage can convert an initially gradient and variable distribution of lexical behaviours into a more categorical and simpler pattern.},

The resulting particulate model of category contents allows the application of evolution theory in modeling category change, because variation in categorized percepts is reflected in the distribution of exemplars in a category. Within a production-perception feedback loop, variation within an exemplar-based category provides a reserve of variants that can serve as the seeds for shifts in the system over time through random or selection-driven asymmetries in production and perception. Here, three potential pathways for evolutionary change are identified in linguistic categories: pruning of lines of inheritance, blending inheritance and natural selection. Simulations of each of these pathways are shown within a simple exemplar-based model of category production and perception, showing how consideration of evolutionary processes may contribute to our understanding of linguis...},

@phdthesis{wedel04phdSelfOrgPhonology,
	Abstract = {Generative models of phonology account for output patterns through a complex grammar applied over a minimal lexicon. In contrast, many natural complex patterns result from the gradual accumulation of structure through repeated local interactions. In this dissertation I present results of simulations supporting the proposal that some phonological patterns can be accounted for through self-organization within an analogically structured lexicon, in response to forcing from external biases. In Chapter 1, I show that patterns accounted for by the Optimality-Theoretic principles of constraint dominance and strict constraint dominance can be shown to spontaneously arise in analogically-structured systems, driven by competition between leveling pressures within the lexicon and differentiating pressures from lexicon- external performance biases. <p> Phonological systems exhibit `constrained contrast' in two distinct ways: first, phonologies exhibit only a subset of cross-linguistically attested contrasts, formed from a subset of possible features in combination. Second, crosslinguistically infrequent elements also tend to occur less frequently in a language that does have them. In Chapter 2, I present evidence that both of these patterns can be accounted for diachronically through indirect selection over phonetic variants, given the assumptions that, 1) lexical categories are richly specified, 2) a perceived utterance updates the content of a lexical category only if it is identified as an example of that lexical category, and 3) lexical categories can influence each others' production in proportion to phonological similarity. <p> When a simulated speaker/hearer pair alternately communicate their lexicons to each other under these conditions their lexicons converge. Further, when an output is too close to multiple categories, it is less likely be consistently categorized, with the result that it has less influence on the evolution of the pairs' lexicons, resulting in pressure on lexical categories to remain contrastive. W hen biases against certain features or feature combinations are introduced, the pairs' lexicons evolve to avoid as many of these `less-fit' elements as possible. However, when avoidance of all marked elements would result in insufficient contrast, the lexicons evolve to utilize a subset of less-fit elements, but at a lower frequency than fitter elements.},

A growing body of work also suggests that divergence may not occur not across the board in such situations. Rather, some features may diverge, while others converge. We model this outcome as an interaction between low-level imitative tendencies in production and processing and a hypothesized higher-level tendency to choose identifiably in-group utterance targets in production. The general imitative tendency that we model here is the perceptual magnet effect, which over time should promote general convergence between linguistic features over time. In contrast, a tendency to produce identifiably in-group utterances should promote gradual divergence. Within a dynamical-systems model of language, we show that these conflicting mechanisms do not simply cancel out, but rather interact to produce a more complex outcome in which a small number of features diverge against a backdrop of general convergence.},

Starting with random neural networks, the simulation resulted in a progression of generations that exhibit increasingly effective mate-finding strategies. In addition, a number of distinct subspecies, i.e., groups with different signaling protocols or 'dialects,' evolve and compete. These protocols become a behavioral barrier to mating that supports the formation of distinct subspecies. Experiments with physical barriers in the environment were also performed. A partially permeable barrier allows a separate subspecies to evolve and survive for indefinite periods of time, in spite of occasional migration and contact from members of other subspecies.},

Traditional accounts and simulation models of the evolution of communication offer little explanation of this diversity. Sexual selection of signals used to attract mates, and the coevolving preferences used to judge those signals, can instead provide a convincing mechanism. Here we demonstrate that a wide variety of ``songs'' can evolve when male organisms sing their songs to females who judge each male's output and decide whether or not to mate with him based on their own coevolved aesthetics. Evolved variety and rate of innovation are greatest when females combine inherited song preferences with a desire to be surprised. If females choose mates from a small pool of candidates, diversity and rate of change are also increased. Such diversity of communication signals may have implications for the evolution of brains as well.},

	Abstract = {Humans possess a number concept that differs from its predecessors in animal cognition in two crucial respects: (1) it is based on a numerical sequence whose elements are not confined to quantitative contexts, but can indicate cardinal/quantitative as well as ordinal and even nominal properties of empirical objects (e.g. `five buses': cardinal; `the fifth bus': ordinal; `the #5 bus': nominal), and (2) it can involve recursion and, via recursion, discrete infinity. In contrast to that, the predecessors of numerical cognition that we find in animals and human infants rely on finite and iconic representations that are limited to cardinality and do not support a unified concept of number. <p> In this paper, I argue that the way such a unified number concept could evolve in humans is via verbal sequences that are employed as numerical tools, that is, sequences of words whose elements are associated with empirical objects in number assignments. In particular, I show that a certain kind of number words, namely the counting sequences of natural languages, can be characterised as a central instance of verbal numerical tools. <p> I describe a possible scenario for the emergence of such verbal numerical tools in human history that starts from iconic roots and that suggests that in a process of co-evolution, the gradual emergence of counting sequences and the development of an increasingly comprehensive number concept supported each other. <p> On this account, it is language that opened the way for numerical cognition, suggesting that it is no accident that the same species that possesses the language faculty as a unique trait, should also be the one that developed a systematic concept of number.},

@techreport{wiesman01automaticOntology,
	Abstract = {Agent communication languages such as ACL and KQML provide a standard for agent communication. These languages enable an agent to specify the intention and the content of a message as well as the protocol, the language, and the ontology that are used. For the protocol and the language some standards are available and should be known by the communicating agents. The ontology used in a communication depends on the subject of the communication. Since the number of subjects is almost infinite and since the concepts used for a subject can be described by different ontologies, the development of generally accepted standards will take a long time. This lack of standardization, which hampers communication and collaboration between agents, is known as the interoperability problem. To overcome the interoperability problem, agents must be able to establish a mapping between their ontologies. This paper investigates a new approach to the interoperability problem. The proposed approach requires neither a correspondence between concepts used in the ontologies nor a correspondence between the structure of the ontologies. It only requires that some instances of the subject about which the agents try to communicate are known by both agents.},

@article{wray05lingua,
	Abstract = {We explore the proposal that the linguistic forms and structures employed by our earliest language-using ancestors might have been significantly different from those observed in the languages we are most familiar with today, not because of a biological difference between them and us, but because the communicative context in which they operated was fundamentally different from that of most modern humans. Languages that are used predominantly for esoteric (intra-group) communication tend to have features that are semantically and grammatically 'complex', while those used also (or even exclusively) for exoteric (inter-group) communication become 'simplified' towards rule-based regularity and semantic transparency. Drawing on a range of contemporary data, we propose a psycholinguistic explanation for why esotericity would promote such complexity, and argue that this is the natural default setting for human language. This being so, it should be taken into account when modelling the evolution of language, for some of the features that are normally viewed as fundamental - including the notion of fully developed underlying rule-based systematicity - may, in fact, be cultural add-ons.},

@phdthesis{yamauchi04phd,
	Abstract = {Since Hinton & Nowlan published their seminal paper (Hinton & Nowlan 1987), the neglected evolutionary process of the Baldwin effect has been widely acknowledged. Especially in the field of language evolution, the Baldwin effect (Baldwin 1896d, Simpson 1953) has been expected to salvage the long-lasting deadlocked situation of modern linguistics: i.e., it may shed light on the relationship between environment and innateness in the formation of language. <p> However, as intense research of this evolutionary theory goes on, certain robust difficulties have become apparent. One example is genotype-phenotype correlation. By computer simulations, both Yamauchi (1999, 2001) and Mayley (1996b) show that for the Baldwin effect to work legitimately, correlation between genotypes and phenotypes is the most essential underpinning. This is due to the fact that this type of the Baldwin effect adopts as its core mechanism Waddington's (1975) `genetic assimilation'. In this mechanism, phenocopies have to be genetically closer to the innately predisposed genotype. Unfortunately this is an overly na¨{\'y}ssumption for the theory of language evolution. As a highly complex cognitive ability, the possibility that this type of genotype-phenotype correlation exists in the domain of linguistic ability is vanishingly small. <p> In this thesis, we develop a new type of mechanism, called `Baldwinian Niche Construction (BNC), that has a rich explanatory power and can potentially overcome this bewildering problem of the Baldwin effect. BNC is based on the theory of niche construction that has been developed by Odling-Smee et al. (2003). The incorporation of the theory into the Baldwin effect was first suggested by Deacon (1997) and briefly introduced by Godfrey-Smith (2003). However, its formulation is yet incomplete. <p> In the thesis, first, we review the studies of the Baldwin effect in both biology and the study of language evolution. Then the theory of BNC is more rigorously developed. Linguistic communication has an intrinsic property that is fundamentally described in the theory of niche construction. This naturally leads us to the theoretical necessity of BNC in language evolution. By creating a new linguistic niche, learning discloses a previously hidden genetic variance on which the Baldwin `canalizing' effect can take place. It requires no genetic modification in a given genepool. There is even no need that genes responsible for learning occupy the same loci as genes for the innate linguistic knowledge. These and other aspects of BNC are presented with some results from computer simulations.},

	Abstract = {Recent demonstrations of statistical learning in infants have reinvigorated the innateness versus learning debate in language acquisition. This article addresses these issues from both computational and developmental perspectives. First, I argue that statistical learning using transitional probabilities cannot reliably segment words when scaled to a realistic setting (e.g. childdirected English). To be successful, it must be constrained by knowledge of phonological structure. Then, turning to the bona fide theory of innateness -- the Principles and Parameters framework -- I argue that a full explanation of children's grammar development must abandon the domain-specific learning model of triggering, in favor of probabilistic learning mechanisms that might be domain-general but nevertheless operate in the domain-specific space of syntactic parameters.},

	Abstract = {If every productive form of linguistic expression can be described by some idealized human grammar, an individuals's variable linguistic behavior (Weinreich, Labov, & Herzog, 1968) can be modeled as a statistical distribution of multiple idealized grammars. The distribution of grammars is determined by the interaction between the biological constraints on human grammar and the properties of linguistic data in the environment during the course of language acquisition. Such interaction can be formalized precisely and quantitatively in a mathematical model of language learning. Consequently, we model language change as the change in grammar distribution over time, which can be related to the statistical properties of historical linguistic data. As an empirical test, we apply the proposed model to explain the loss of the verb-second phenomenon in Old French and Old English based on corpus studies of historical texts.},

	Abstract = {This paper argues that developmental patterns in child language be taken seriously in computational models of language acquisition, and proposes a formal theory that meets this criterion. We first present developmental facts that are problematic for statistical learning approaches which assume no prior knowledge of grammar, and for traditional learnability models which assume the learner moves from one UG-defined grammar to another. In contrast, we view language acquisition as a population of grammars associated with 'weights', that compete in a Darwinian selectionist process. Selection is made possible by the variational properties of individual grammars; specifically, their differential compatibility with the primary linguistic data in the environment. In addition to a convergence proof, we present empirical evidence in child language development, that a learner is best modeled as multiple grammars in co-existence and competition.},

@article{yang08structuredLanguageGames,
	Abstract = {We propose an asymmetric negotiation strategy to investigate the influence of high-degree agents on the agreement dynamics in a structured language game, the naming game. We introduce a model parameter, which governs the frequency of high-degree agents acting as speakers in communication. It is found that there exists an optimal value of the parameter that induces the fastest convergence to a global consensus on naming an object for both scale-free and small-world naming games. This phenomenon indicates that, although a strong influence of high-degree agents favors consensus achievement, very strong influences inhibit the convergence process, making it even slower than in the absence of influence of high-degree agents. Investigation of the total memory used by agents implies that there is some trade-off between the convergence speed and the required total memory. Other quantities, including the evolution of the number of different names and the relationship between agents' memories and their degrees, are also studied. The results are helpful for better understanding of the dynamics of the naming game with asymmetric negotiation strategy.},

@article{Yu05linksBetweenLexicalAndObject,
	Abstract = {Language is about symbols, and those symbols must be grounded in the physical world. Children learn to associate language with sensorimotor experiences during their development. In light of this, we first provide a computational account of how words are mapped to their perceptually grounded meanings. Moreover, the main part of this work proposes and implements a computational model of how word learning influences the formation of object categories to which those words refer. This model simulates the bi-directional relationship between word and object category learning: (1) object categorization provides mental representations of meanings that are mapped to words to form lexical items; (2) linguistic labels help object categorization by providing additional teaching signals; and (3) these two learning processes interplay with each other and form a developmental feedback loop. Compared with the method that performs these two tasks separately, our model shows promising improvements in both word-to-world mapping and perceptual categorization, suggesting a unified view of lexical and category learning in an integrative framework. Most importantly, this work provides a cognitively plausible explanation of the mechanistic nature of early word learning and object learning from co-occurring multisensory data.},

A two-parameter stochastic multiplicative process is proposed as a model for the population dynamics of individual languages, and applied over a period spanning the last ten centuries. The model disregards language birth and death. A straightforward fitting of the two parameters, which statistically characterize the population growth rate, predicts a distribution of language sizes in excellent agreement with empirical data.

	Abstract = {Grammaticalisation is relevant for language evolution in two ways. First, it is possible to model grammaticalisation processes by evolutionary simulations (iterated learning). This paper provides two such models of a central step in the grammaticalisation process: the recruitment of lexical and functional words for a new functional role. These models help in better understanding the processes involved. Second, it is possible to reason backwards to earlier stages of human language. The paper argues that all that is necessary for the genesis of natural languages is the conventionality of the form-meaning association and the possibility of introducing new lexical words. Once there is a communication system of this kind, all the additional complexities of human languages follow.},

@phdthesis{zuidema05phd,
	Abstract = {The origins of human language, with its extraordinarily complex structure and multitude of functions, remains among the most challenging problems for evolutionary biology and the cognitive sciences. Although many will agree progress on this issue would have important consequences for linguistic theory, many remain sceptical about whether the topic is amenable to rigorous, scientific research at all. Complementing recent developments toward better empirical validation, this thesis explores how formal models from both linguistics and evolutionary biology can help to constrain the many theories and scenarios in this field. <p> I first review a number of foundational mathematical models from three branches of evolutionary biology -- population genetics, evolutionary game theory and social evolution theory -- and discuss the relation between them. This discussion yields a list of ten requirements on evolutionary scenarios for language, and highlights the assumptions implicit in the various formalisms. I then look in more details at one specific step-by-step scenario, proposed by Ray Jackendoff, and consider the linguistic formalisms that could be used to characterise the evolutionary transitions from one stage to the next. I conclude from this review that the main challenges in evolutionary linguistics are to explain how three major linguistic innovations -- combinatorial phonology, compositional semantics and hierarchical phrase-structure -- could have spread through a population where they are initially rare. <p> In the second part of the thesis, I critically evaluate some existing formal models of each of these major transitions and present three novel alternatives. In an abstract model of the evolution of speech sounds (viewed as trajectories through an acoustic space), I show that combinatorial phonology is a solution for robustness against noise and the only evolutionary stable strategy (ESS). In a model of the evolution of simple lexicons in a noisy environment, I show that the optimal lexicon uses a structured mapping from meanings to sounds, providing a rudimentary compositional semantics. Lexicons with this property are also ESS's. Finally, in a model of the evolution and acquisition of context-free grammars, I evaluate the conditions under which hierarchical phrase-structure will be favoured by natural selection, or will be the outcome of a process of cultural evolution. <p> In the last chapter of the thesis, I discuss the implications of these models for the debates in linguistics on innateness and learnability, and on the nature of language universals. A mainly negative point to make is that formal learnability results cannot be used as evidence for an innate, language-specific specialisation for language. A positive point is that with the evolutionary models of language, we can begin to under- stand how universal properties and tendencies in natural languages can result from the intricate interaction between innate learning biases and a process of cultural evolution over many generations.},

	Abstract = {Compositionality is one of the fundamental properties of natural language. Explaining its evolution remains a challenging problem because most existing explanations require a structured language to be already present in the population before compositionality can successfully spread in a population. In this paper, I study whether a communication system can evolve that shows the preservation of topology between meaning-space and signal-space, without assuming that individuals have any prior processing mechanism for compositionality. I present a formalism to describe a communication system where there is noise in signaling and variation in the values of meanings. In contrast to previous models, both the noise and values depend on the topology of the signal- and meaning spaces. I study a model of a population of agents that each try to optimize their communicative success under these circumstances. The results show that the preservation of topology between follows naturally from the assumptions on noise, values and individual-based optimization.},

Thus it complements psycholinguistics, which investigates the processes involved in individual adult language processing, and child language development studies, which investigate how children learn a given (fixed) language. We focus on the framework of language games and argue that they offer a fresh and formal perspective on many current debates in cognitive science, including those on the synchronic-versus-diachronic perspective on language, the embodiment and situatedness of language and cognition, and the self-organization of linguistic patterns. We present a measure for the quality of a lexicon in a population, and derive four characteristics of the optimal lexicon: specificity, coherence, distinctiveness, and regularity. We present a model of lexical dynamics that shows the spontaneous emergence of these characteristics in a distributed population of individuals that incorporate embodiment constraints. Finally, we discuss how research in cognitive science could contribute to improving existing language game models.},

	Abstract = {Among the several findings deriving from the application of complex network formalism to the investigation of natural phenomena, the fact that linguistic constructions follow power laws presents special interest for its potential implications for psychology and brain science. By corresponding to one of the most essentially human manifestations, such language-related properties suggest that similar dynamics may also be inherent to the brain areas related to language and associative memory, and perhaps even consciousness. The present work reports a preliminary experimental investigation aimed at characterizing and modeling the flow of sequentially induced associations between words from the English language in terms of complex networks. The data is produced through a psychophysical experiment where a word is presented to the subject, who is requested to associate another word. Complex network and graph theory formalism and measurements are applied in order to characterize the experimental data. Several interesting results are identified, including the characterization of attraction basins, association asymmetries, context biasing, as well as a possible power-law underlying word associations, which could be explained by the appearance of strange loops along the hierarchical structure underlying word categories.},

Language is a complex dynamic system that can be studied at the level of the individual and at the level of the population. Much of the dynamics of language evolution and language change occur because of the interaction of these two levels. It is argued that this interaction is too complicated to study with pen-and-paper analysis alone and that computer models therefore provide a useful tool for understanding language evolution. Different techniques are presented: direct optimization, genetic algorithms and agent-based models. Of each of these techniques, an example is briefly presented. Also, the importance of correctly measuring and presenting the results of computer simulations is stressed.},

	Abstract = {Much is known about the evolution of speech. Fossil evidence points to modern adaptations for speech appearing between 1.5 million and 500,000 years ago. Studies of vocal behavior in apes show the ability to use combinatorial vocalizations in some species (but not chimpanzees) and some cultural influence on vocalizations, but little ability for vocal imitation. For modern speech, the comparison of many languages shows that speech can become extremely complex, but that it can also be astonishingly simple. Finally, the way in which infants acquire speech is becoming increasingly clear. We therefore know about the starting point of the evolution of speech, its end point and some steps in between. <p> Much less is known about the exact scenario and the dynamics of the evolution of the acquisition of speech. As it involves co-evolution between culturally transmitted sounds and genetic evolution, the dynamics are complex. Computer models are therefore ideal for studying these dynamics. This paper presents a computer model of the co-evolution between a repertoire of speech sounds and a population of learners that can either represent a lexicon holistically or combinatorially. It shows that cultural influences can change the dynamics of the transition between a population of holistic and combinatorial learners.},

	Abstract = {This paper investigates the interaction between cultural evolution and biological evolution in the emergence of phonemic coding in speech. It is observed that our nearest relatives, the primates, use holistic utterances, whereas humans use phonemic utterances. It can therefore be argued that our last common ancestor used holistic utterances and that these must have evolved into phonemic utterances. This involves co-evolution between a repertoire of speech sounds and adaptations to using phonemic speech. The culturally transmitted system of speech sounds influences the fitness of the agents and could conceivably block the transition from holistic to phonemic speech. This paper investigates this transition using a computer model in which agents that can either use holistic or phonemic utterances co-evolve with a lexicon of words. The lexicon is adapted by the speakers to conform to their preferences. It is shown that although the dynamics of the transition are changed, the population still ends up of agents that use phonemic speech.},

	Abstract = {This paper describes an investigation of two computer models of how vowel systems can be transferred from one generation to the next. Humans tend to reduce the articulation of the vowels (and other speech sounds) they produce. If infants would learn on the basis of these reduced signals, vowel systems would collapse rapidly over time. As this is not observed in practice, some mechanism must be present to counter it. Two candidate mechanisms are investigated in this paper: compensatory expansion of articulations learned on the basis of reduced speech sounds and learning on the basis of more carefully articulated speech. It turns out that larger vowel systems with central vowels can only remain stable when learning is based on carefully articulated speech.},

Both are considered as the result of self-organisation in a population of language users. The language users try to imitate each other and to learn each other's vowel systems as well as possible under constraints of production and perception, while at the same time maximising the number of available speech sounds. It is shown through computer simulations that coherent and natural sound systems can indeed emerge in populations of artificial agents. It is also shown that the mechanism that is responsible for the emergence of sound systems can be used for learning existing sound systems as well. Finally, it is argued that the simulation of agents that can only produce isolated vowels is not enough.

The agents (small computer programs that operate autonomously) are equipped with a realistic articulatory synthesizer, a model of human perception and the ability to imitate and learn sounds they hear.

This happens under a large number of different parameter settings and therefore seems to be a very robust phenomenon. The emerged vowel systems show remarkable similarities with the vowel systems found in human languages.

@article{deboer01evolutionAnd,
	Abstract = {This paper describes computer simulations that investigate the role of self-organisation in explaining the universals of human vowel systems. It has been observed that human vowel systems show remarkable regularities, and that these regularities optimise acoustic distinctiveness and are therefore adaptive for good communication. Traditionally, universals have been explained as the result of innate properties of the human language faculty, and therefore need an evolutionary explanation. In this paper it is argued that the regularities emerge as the result of self-organisation in a population and therefore need not be the result of biological evolution. \\ The hypothesis is investigated with two different computer simulations that are based on a population of agents that try to imitate each other as well as possible. Each agent can produce and perceive vowels in a human-like way and stores vowels as articulatory and acoustic prototypes. The aim of the agents is to imitate each other as well as possible. \\ It will be shown that successful repertoires of vowels emerge that show the same regularities as human vowel systems.},

@phdthesis{deboer99selfOrganisation,
	Abstract = {The research described in this thesis tries to explain the origins and the struc- ture of human sound systems (and more specifically human vowel systems) as the result of self-organisation in a population under functional con- straints. These constraints are: acoustic distinctiveness, articulatory ease and ease of learning. The process is modelled with computer simulations, following the meth- odology of artificial life and artificial intelligence. The research is part of a larger re- search effort into understanding the origins and the nature of language and intelli- gence. <p> The emergence of sound systems is studied in a setting called the imitation game. In an imitation game, agents from a population interact in order to imitate each other as well as possible. Imitation is a binary process: it is either successful or a failure. Agents are able to produce and perceive speech sounds in a human-like way, and to adapt and extend their repertoires of speech sounds in reaction to the outcome of the imitation games. The agents' vowel repertoires are initially empty and are bootstrapped by random insertion of a speech sound when an agent with an empty repertoire wants to produce a sound. When the agents' repertoires are not empty anymore, random insertion does not happen anymore, except with very low probability. This low-probability random insertion is done in order to keep a pres- sure on the agents to extend their number of vowels. . <p> As the agents' repertoires are initially empty and their production and percep- tion are not biased towards any language in particular, the systems of speech sounds that emerge are language-independent and can be considered predictions of the kinds of systems of speech sounds that can be found in human languages. <p> The main focus of the thesis is on the emergence of vowel systems. It is shown that coherent, successful and realistic vowel systems emerge for a wide range of pa- rameter settings in the simulation. When the vowel systems are compared with the types of vowel systems that are found in human languages, remarkable similarities are found. Not only are the most frequently found human vowel systems predicted, (this could already be done with direct optimisation of acoustic distinctiveness) but also less frequently occurring vowel systems are predicted in approximately the right proportions. <p> Variations on the basic imitation game show that it is remarkably robust. Not only do coherent, successful and realistic vowel systems emerge for a large number of parameter settings, but they also emerge when either the imitation game or the agents are changed qualitatively. Coherent and realistic systems still emerge when the perception and production of the agents are changed. Even if the rules of the imitation game are slightly changed, coherent and realistic systems still emerge. Of course, there are circumstances under which no systems emerge, indicating that the process is non-trivial. <p> It is also shown that the vowel systems can emerge and be preserved in chang- ing populations. When old agents are removed from the population, and new, empty agents are added, coherent and realistic vowel systems can still emerge, provided that the replacement rate is not too high. It is also shown in the thesis that vowel systems can be preserved in a population, even though all original agents in it have been replaced. Furthermore, it is shown that under certain circumstances it can be advantegeous to have an age-structure in the population, so that older agents learn less quickly than young ones. <p> Finally, some experiments with more complex utterances are presented in the thesis. An experiment with artificial CV-syllables is presented and it is shown that, although phonemically coded (as opposed to holistically coded) systems can emerge, this simulation is much harder and much more sensitive to parameter changes than the vowel simulation. This probably has to do with the fact that in the case of CV- syllables multiple independent and partly contradictory constraints have to be satis- fied simultaneously, whereas in the vowel simulations, only one constraint (acoustic distinctiveness) is really important. Also, the first attempts at building a system that can produce complex and dynamic utterances without any constraints on their structure are presented, and it is argued that the main obstacle to getting such a system to work is the mapping from acoustic signals back to articulatory com- mands. <p> The conclusion of the thesis is that universal tendencies of human vowel sys- tems, and probably of human sound systems in general can be explained as the re- sult of self-organisation in a population of agents that try to communicate as well as possible under articulatory and acoustic constraints. The articulatory and acoustic constraints cause the emerging sound systems to tend towards articulatory and acoustic optimality. However, the fact that the agents communicate in a population forces them to conform to the sound system in the population and causes sub- optimal systems to emerge as well.},

@phdthesis{dejong00autonomousFormation,
	Abstract = {The research in this thesis addresses the question of how autonomous agents may develop concepts about their environment and develop a system of communication that allows them to exchange information about this environment based on those concepts. An autonomous agent is a system, in software or in hardware, that receives sensor input from the environment, selects actions, and may receive evaluative feedback reflecting the appropriateness of its actions. Communication is viewed as the transfer of information, in the sense that when a sender sends a message to a receiver, the amount of uncertainty in the receiver's knowledge about its environment decreases as a result of receiving the message. When agents have incomplete knowledge about their environment, communication can be valuable as a means to reduce this uncertainty by sharing information, and can be used to coordinate the actions of agents. Communication is learned during the life time of the agents, and the research concerns the question of how agents may cooperate to arrive at a shared system of communication. <p> Features of the information available to an agent through its sensors can be used to construct concepts, also called meanings. Constructing concepts based on the requirements posed by the environment is a more flexible approach than fixing the concepts of agents at design time, and may be necessary when the agents are to function in unknown or changing environments. <p> In this thesis, a particular type of concepts is described, called situation concepts. Situation concepts consist of features in the history of interaction between the agent and its environment, which consists of sensor data, actions, and subsequent evaluative feedback. A defining criterion of a situation concept is that it predicts some aspect of the future evolution of the state of the environment, possibly conditioned on the actions the agent may take. Several existing methods, particularly from the field of reinforcement learning, can be viewed as constructing a form of situation concepts. A particular method for constructing a specific type of situation concepts, called the adaptive subspace method, is described. The method uses the current sensor values of an agent as features and develops concepts that specify an interval for each sensor. These concepts predict the value of actions the agent can take when its current sensor values are within the specified intervals. The meanings thus formed represent situations, and are especially appropriate for use in communication, since they convey information about the environment. <p> The development of communication is viewed as the formation of associations between words and the meanings formed by the agents in a population, in such a way that agents tend to use the same word in the same situation. When agents autonomously construct concepts, a consequence is that they may not possess identical concepts. Additional constraints that are respected, such as the commitment that agents have no direct access to the meanings formed by other agents (they can not 'look inside each other's head'), and that no single agent may decide on the system of communication, further complicate the problem of how such a system of associations may come about. <p> Rather than viewing communication as fixed, it is viewed as a dynamical system. A dynamical system is a mathematical model of a system that changes over time. The variables of this system are the strengths of the associations between words and the meanings of the agents in a population. An algorithm is described in detail that, when used by each individual agent to adapt its associations between words and the situation concepts it has formed, leads to a shared system of communication. <p> The necessity of different components of the algorithm is shown with statistical significance. Associations are linear combinations of use (the frequency with which a word is observed in a situation) and success (the degree to which the word correctly indicates that its associated situation is the current situation in the environment). Analysis of the success component of the algorithm showed that not the success information itself, but the lateral inhibition between competing associations is crucial for the development of communication. It is experimentally demonstrated how the development of communication can compensate for differences in conceptual systems. <p> Systematic measures have been introduced to determine the quality of conceptual systems and communication systems. The measures require knowledge of the ideal concepts, called referents; although such knowledge is not available in general, simulation experiments often do provide the opportunity for such referents to be determined. <p> The specificity measure for communication is based on the principle that knowledge of a word should yield information (i.e. reduce uncertainty) about the referent (the current situation in the environment), and vice versa for the consistency measure. In cases of maximal specificity, the information a word yields is complete, and thus identifies the situation, whereas in the worst case, the word does not yield any information at all. The measure quantifies these and all intermediate cases. The consistency measure is computed as the extent to which a referent identifies a word, and thus expresses whether for each a referent the agent consistently uses the same word. If both specificity and consistency are high, each agent consistently uses a unique word for each referent. A population measure called coherence is used to determine whether different agents use the same words. In combination with the specificity and consistency measures, the experimenter can determine to what degree a perfect system of communication, consistently linking each referent to a unique word, is approximated. <p> Interestingly, the same principle can be used to evaluate the quality of a conceptual system. Ideally, each concept an agent has formed identifies a single referent in the environment; this is expressed by the distinctiveness measure, calculated as the degree to which the meanings an agent possesses distinguish between the different referents. Conversely, parsimony expresses the degree to which a referent identifies a meaning. It thus reflects whether the agent has not generated more meanings than necessary. Together, high distinctiveness and high parsimony imply that a conceptual system is ideal in the sense that it approximates a one-to-one relation between meanings and referents. <p> A contribution is made to the viewpoint of communication as a dynamical system by considering the attractors in the communication system that has been described. A deterministic version of the system is proved mathematically and demonstrated experimentally to have point attractors that correspond to perfect communication. An operational definition of pseudo-attractors is used to demonstrate that the stochastic system has points that play a similar role. Stochasticity is found to be a useful ingredient in the development of communication, in that it avoids deadlocks and results in communication more consistently and under a wider variety of parameter settings. This finding is confirmed by a systematic investigation of the effect of different amounts of stochasticity, regulated by the temperature parameter that governs word production.

Although none of the agents has a global view of the language, and none of the agents does an explicit optimization, a coherent system of vowels emerges that happens to be optimized for acoustic distinctiveness. The results presented here fit in and confirm the theory of Luc Steels [Steels 1995, 1997, 1998] that views languages as a complex dynamic system and the origins of language as the result of self-organization and cultural evolution.},

First, the notion of a perfect communication system is defined. Next, two measures of communication system quality are specified. It is shown that maximization of these measures leads to perfect communication production. Based on this principle, local adaptation rules for communication development are constructed. The resulting stochastic algorithm is validated in computational experiments. Empirical analysis indicates that a mild degree of stochasticity is instrumental in reaching states that correspond to accurate communication.},

In the approach, we ascribe to each language a fitness function which depends on the number of people that speak that language. Here, we extend the aforementioned model to examine the role of saturation of the fitness on the language dynamics. We found that the dependence of the linguistic diversity on the area after colonization displays a power law regime with a nontrivial exponent in very good agreement with the measured exponent associated with the actual distribution of languages on the Earth.},

Taking alarm calls as an example, we show that if the temptation to cheat is low, a single signal is used in the population. If the temptation increases cheaters will erode the credibility of a signal, and an honest mutant using a different signal ('a private code') will be very successful until this, in turn, is cracked by cheaters. In such a system, signal use fluctuates in time and space and hence the meaning of a given signal is not constant. When the temptation to cheat is too large, no honest communication can maintain itself in a Tower of Babel of many signals. We discuss our analysis in the light of the Green Beard mechanism for the evolution of altruism.},

In our sample, all languages with more than 50% second language speakers had no nominal case. The negative association between the number of second language speakers and nominal case complexity generalizes to different language areas and families. As there are many studies attesting to the difficulty of acquiring morphological case in second language acquisition, this result supports the idea that languages adapt to the cognitive constraints of their speakers, as well as to the sociolinguistic niches of their speaking communities. We discuss our results with respect to sociolinguistic typology and the Linguistic Niche Hypothesis, as well as with respect to qualitative data from historical linguistics. All in all, multiple lines of evidence converge on the idea that morphosyntactic complexity is reduced by a high degree of language contact involving adult learners.},

@article{Isbell_Young_1996,
	Abstract = {<P> One hypothesis for the evolution of hominid bipedalism is that bipedalism was more efficient than quadrupedalism for long-distance terrestrial locomotion, and was favored when resources became scarcer and more widely separated during the drying of African forests in the Miocene. Here we extend this scenario for the evolution of bipedalism based on principles of behavioral ecology of extant primates. Daily travel distance is not only an increasing function of resource scarcity, but also of group size (because of intragroup scramble competition). When faced with Miocene drying, hominoids were forced to evolve either energetically more efficient locomotory abilities or smaller group sizes. The cost of the latter strategy is that smaller groups are less successful than larger groups in intergroup contest competition (smaller groups are supplanted from limiting resources). Among the earliest hominids, bipedalism may have been favored over small group size as an alternative energetic response to decreased resource availability. The alternative was to maintain quadrupedal locomotion but evolve fission-fusion grouping to reduce daily travel distance for individuals and hence, their energetic costs of travel. We suggest that this strategy represents the evolutionary pathway taken by chimpanzees. This divergence of strategies may have been a result of inherent differences in feeding ecology, but could also have been enhanced by the pre-empting of niche space by the two closely related and presumably competing hominoid ancestors of humans and chimpanzees. If so, it could have been a potential factor in the speciation process that led to modern humans and chimpanzees.</P>},
